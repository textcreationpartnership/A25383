            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>hope</hi> that we <hi>shall</hi> be happy in <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Now amongst the severall <hi>Requisites</hi> and

<hi>Toledo</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to call it. The <hi>Reading</hi> of the

               <hi>humbled himselfe, and wept,</hi> and <hi>rent his cloathes,</hi> and
<hi>made a Covenant before the Lord, to keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements and his Statutes, and perform the words of the Covenant which were written in that booke;</hi> Nor is it unworthy to be ruminated upon; That though <hi>Moses</hi> was <hi>Theopneust,</hi> the <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Favorite</hi> of God (as well as <hi>Abraham</hi>) and sure as able to speake, <hi>without booke,</hi> the mind and Tenour of the <hi>Law,</hi> as any man that ever lived
<hi>before</hi> or <hi>after,</hi> yet he thought it as <hi>effectual</hi> to the saving of <hi>Soules,</hi> to <hi>take the booke of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> which he had first <hi>transcribed</hi> from God's owne <hi>Preaching</hi> upon the <hi>Mountaine,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely <hi>to

            <p>Besides, it may be pleaded in his <hi>excuse</hi> (by such as are willing to make the <hi>best</hi> of a <hi>bold adventure,</hi> not because it is <hi>bold,</hi> but because it is <hi>past,</hi> and now <hi>too late</hi> to be <hi>prevented</hi>) That next to the <hi>Authors</hi> and <hi>Composers</hi> of <hi>learned Works,</hi> their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servators</hi> and <hi>Guardians</hi> deserve most <hi>thanks</hi> and <hi>commendations.</hi> We think we owe a great deal to such as <hi>Photius,</hi> and <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> (and the

               <pb facs="tcp:62585:13"/>of
<hi>Diodorus Siculus, Polybius, Ingens Livius,</hi> and <hi>Dion Cassius?</hi> Or that we have <hi>lost</hi> so many <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes</hi> of learned Writers in the <hi>Church,</hi> such as <hi>Melito, Theophilus, Tatianus, Irenaeus, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus, Hippolytus, Origen,</hi> and the like, but because there were not in all times, men of <hi>faithfull, industrious,</hi> and <hi>publick Souls?</hi> Yet we reckon our selves <hi>obliged</hi> to such as will lend us the very <hi>Ruines</hi> of <hi>Methodius</hi> of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and

            <p>But now for mine own part, I must ingenuously confesse, that though I finde my self more <hi>usefully</hi> and <hi>deliciously</hi> entertained with the very least <hi>frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> than with the <hi>fullest</hi> spread <hi>Tables</hi> of those <hi>new Men,</hi> who <hi>uninvite</hi> the People to be his <hi>Guests,</hi> and train them up to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Diet;</hi> yet in reverence to the <hi>Fame</hi> of so

<hi>submission</hi> to the most <hi>wise determinations</hi> of those two Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and learned Prelates, who were <hi>alone intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted</hi> with the
<hi>disposal</hi> of his <hi>Works,</hi> I should <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> have consented to the divulging of these <hi>Notes,</hi> had I been <hi>timely</hi> consulted with <hi>before</hi> they were<pb facs="tcp:62585:13"/>
               <hi>finished</hi> at the
<hi>Presse.</hi> Not only for those reasons which I finde to have been given by the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and of <hi>Ely,</hi> both in their
<hi>English</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Prefaces,</hi> before his <hi>English</hi> and
<hi>Latine Works,</hi> but for divers other reasons which are too
<hi>obvious</hi> to need a <hi>prompter.</hi> I know that the <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> of this <hi>Great Author</hi> (that is to say, of the <hi>Church of England</hi>) doe love to take their <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> of him, not from his
<hi>latest,</hi> and most <hi>mature,</hi> but from his <hi>youngest</hi> and
<hi>crudest</hi> Writings. I know the <hi>injuries</hi> he hath suffered by the
<hi>unwarranted publications</hi> of some few things which are found to
<hi>vary</hi> from that which is <hi>known</hi> to be his <hi>last and ripest judgement.</hi> I know what <hi>calumnies</hi> are <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi> upon his equally <hi>beloved</hi> and <hi>friendly Grotius</hi> through the
<hi>licentious</hi> publication of his <hi>posthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Works.</hi> I know his infinite <hi>Improvements</hi> from after that time when he was <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>St. Giles;</hi> and his <hi>dislikes</hi> of all preaching, which, by being too <hi>frequent,</hi> is withall too <hi>loose.</hi> Thence was his
<hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> upon himself (recorded by Bishop <hi>Buckridge</hi> in his
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 21.</note> funerall Sermon) That
<hi>when he preached twise a day at St. Giles, he prated once:</hi> Not but that his very <hi>Table-talk,</hi> and what, in the <hi>depth</hi> of his
<hi>Humility,</hi> he call'd his <hi>prating,</hi> was more <hi>usefull</hi> and more <hi>learned</hi> than the very best <hi>preaching</hi> of them that are <hi>Enemies</hi> to his <hi>Glory</hi> as well as <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,</hi> but because he thought the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was never well enough
<hi>handled,</hi> and that the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was never well enough <hi>done,</hi> until it had received his <hi>utmost care</hi> and
<hi>circumspection.</hi> So <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>modest</hi> was his opinion of his <hi>own</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,<pb facs="tcp:62585:14"/>(however admired by other men) that he seldome (if ever) could give them his <hi>final Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> until they had passed, the <hi>third</hi> time, betwixt the <hi>Hammer</hi> and the <hi>Anvill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which when I consider, I think it my duty to make it known, That I never <hi>heard</hi> of this Volume until I saw it intirely printed, and only have taken this opportunity to preserve the Reader from being
<hi>decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> and the incomparable Author from being <hi>wrong'd.</hi> My
<hi>excusing</hi> of the <hi>publishers</hi> (I mean, my <hi>endeavors</hi> to excuse them) is not meant to imply that they are <hi>innocent,</hi> but is the mercifullest way to conclude them <hi>guilty;</hi> Who commonly <hi>live</hi> and <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,</hi> not by being <hi>over-tender</hi> of the <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,</hi> but by <hi>publishing</hi> the <hi>Writings</hi> of

            <p>Were those <hi>Stenographers</hi> now living, by whose

               </head>
               <p>WEE have heard of the undoubted credit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable Authority of <hi>Moses</hi> the writer: Now touching his hand-writing, hee hath left five Bookes, as five fingers of his hand, to point at the knowledg of God and heavenly things, that so hee might shew them unto us.</p>
               <p>In all which Bookes, wee may observe two principall parts of his intent and purpose: The one was to deliver to Gods Church the Law and Word of God: The other is to write the History of Gods Works.</p>
               <p>First hee sets downe the Creation of the Wold, and all flesh; that after hee might shew the Lawe which was given to all flesh in the World.</p>
               <p>This Historie of the worlds Creation aptly divideth it self into two parts; The first concerneth the old World (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.) which was in <hi>Paradise.</hi> The other, that World which hath been since, and shall be to the end thereof.</p>
               <p>Touching the old World, hee considereth it in its perfection, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and happinesse, in these first two Chapters; and in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, decay, and misery, in the third Chapter: For the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, wee are led to consider the Creation of the World, in the beginning of this Chapter, and the Creation or making of Man, and investing him in <hi>Paradise,</hi> to bee the Lord and Governor of all the World and the things therein.</p>
               <p>The sum of these verses, is the narration of the manner of the rearing up of the frame of all things wee see in heaven and earth; which is a matter of so high, huge, and infinite consideration, that wee should quickly confound and lose our selves in it, if God had<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62585:28"/>not given us this thred of direction in our hands, to bring us out of this intricate maze, which else would astonish us.</p>
               <p>This Creation is divided into six dayes works, in which is shewed the six joynts, as it were, of the frame of the whole World: In which six dayes the proceeding of God in this worke, consisteth in these three points. First, the creating of all Creatures, of and after an indigest, rude and imperfect matter, and manner: For, the first day <hi>was made a rude masse or heape,</hi> which after <hi>was the Earth.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>a bottomlesse huge gulfe, which was the Waters.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>over both was a foggie obscure myst of darknesse which was the Firmament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that, in the second place, is set downe the distinction, which is in three sorts. First, <hi>Of Light from darknesse.</hi> Secondly,
<hi>Of the nether Waters from the upper Waters,</hi> (viz.) <hi>of the Seas and Clouds.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Of the Waters from the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the distinction and dividing of this, ensueth in the third place, Gods worke in beautifying and adorning them after this order which wee now see.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>the Heaven with Starres.</hi> Secondly, <hi>the Ayre with Fowls.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>the Earth with Beasts, Herbs and Plants of all sorts.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>the Sea and Waters with Fishes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And having thus finished this great frame of all the World, and beautified the same as wee see; Then he framed and made Man, the little world, after his Image, and placed him therein, as his Pallace to enjoy and possesse.</p>
               <p>Touching the first part of the Creation, it is set downe in the first verse; in which are foure workes of great weight and importance.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>The first, <hi>In principio;</hi> Second, <hi>Deus;</hi> Third, <hi>creavit;</hi> Fourth, <hi>Coelum &amp; Terram:</hi> For these two, being coupled, doe fall under in one part of the division. In which are offered unto us four princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall matters of great regard.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That this World and the things wee see, were not so ever, but had a beginning at a certain time.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> At the beginning, these things had not their being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Creation and working of them was only of God, and of that God which is in unity of essence and trinity of persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That Heaven and Earth are God's, and that they were made and preserved by him.</p>
               <p>Touching the first (<hi>in principio</hi>) hath admitted a three fold sence, according to the diverse conceits of divers men; all which have beene received, and may bee, without error or danger: First, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi> doe take and interpret it as the Cause, which was the beginning of all, and that is Gods Wisdome; which (as the Cause) began all. And they may seeme to bee led to understand it thus, by these two places, the one in the 4 <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. <hi>Wisedome is the beginning,</hi> &amp;c. the other 104 <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. <hi>In Wisedome hast thou made them all;</hi> Therefore they thought, that in the beginning is meant, <hi>In Wisedome God created,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62585:28"/>Secondly, it is taken for the order of time, as who should say; First of all, and before any thing else was done, God made Heaven and Earth, in the very first beginning of time; that is, in a moment, or as it were in the twinckling of an eye 1; <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52. So had all things their beginning and motion, in the beginning of time; as they shall leave and lose it at the end and last period of time, which is the Worlds end: It is no danger of error thus to understand (<hi>In prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is said (11 <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.) that it is a Mystery and matter of Faith, to beleeve this, of the <hi>Creation, in the beginning,</hi> and so it is; yet God hath not made our reason so repugnant from Faith, even in naturall men; but that even by the sense and sight of things, mans reason cannot deny, but must needs gather and confesse this to be true, <hi>That all things were made, and had a beginning;</hi> And this all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenith Philosphers (as may appeare by all books of the Gentiles, in all ages, since the study of learning, and learned men hath beene) doe plainly shew, that they had in remembrance themselves, and did commend to others by their writings, the knowledge and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of this universal
<hi>Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This hee proveth by those Philosophers which were as ancient as the Prophet <hi>Esdras,</hi> untill late times, and that they had a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>Noah,</hi> naming him <hi>Janus,</hi> and painting him with two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, one looking into the old world before the Flood, and the other beholding the world after: Besides such writers, of naturall men, very reason doth consent hereunto, <hi>That the world was made by some wonderfull Power, and so had a beginning;</hi> for Reason is ever naturally led to look and consider the beginning and cause of any thing it seeth; as when it seeth a great Tree, though it see not the roote, yet it conceiveth, for certain, that it hath a roote which conveyeth sapp to the Tree, by which it groweth and encreaseth: So when it seeth a great River, it by and by concludeth, there is a great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and head where it hath his originall and beginning. Again, Reason cannot abide infinite Causes, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. to say, <hi>the woman came of man, the man of Christ, and Christ of God;</hi> Because di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Causes have divers times and motions; but Reason will bring things to their particular head and chief causes, which by one moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and at one time did it.</p>
               <p>Also in that we say things are done successively, by order of times neerer and farther off, it argueth necessarily a beginning, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith <hi>David Psal.</hi> 119 91. <hi>All things continue alike, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, through thy Ordinance.</hi> All things since in the world have beene yb Gods appointment and Decree. <hi>Psal.</hi> 65.9. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth this to the wise and learned of <hi>Athens,</hi> as a thing which they knew and taught in their Schools to bee true 17 <hi>Acts</hi> 24. And <hi>Plato</hi> faith it was a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great antiquity and credit in his time, and long before; <hi>That God made all things, and man, at a certain time, which was their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> sheweth that some deemed the world to bee conceived<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62585:29"/>and brought forth, and to grow to perfection as a man; and others, that it was the stamp which God set on it, and so all learned men in all ages, and all men endowed with natural sence and right reason have beene resolved in this, <hi>That the world was the workmanship of God, and had his beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The partie adverse to this truth, was the first of the sect of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> which (contrary to his master <hi>Plato,</hi> and all that were hefore him, and contrary to his Scholar <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> and the most that followed him after) held that <hi>Mundus erat aeternus,</hi> and so had no beginning nor maker at all; yet (notwithstanding this new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and opinion) hee confesseth this twice or thrice, that hee giveth credit to those ancient men which were before him, which by long grounded experience, and by evident demonstration, and credible testimonies held and taught otherwise then hee thought, and in his book <hi>de Coelo,</hi> hee saith that there was a <hi>Chaos,</hi> a darknesse and light which had a beginning, therefore as hee seemeth to differ, and leave his ancients, of singularity only, on a conceit and devise of his own, so his Scholers and followers after him, forsook him in that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore this point standeth undoubted; as ratified both by evidence of reason, and by the judgement of the learned in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The second Point is the Creation, in which wee are to note first, that the things which wee see were not of themselves, when they had their being and beginning, because they are an effect and worke of some efficient cause; for it is very absurd in reason, that one and the same thing should bee both a Cause and an Effect of it selfe, for so it must bee granted that a thing both was and was not at one time; for as it is the Cause, it must needes bee before it was, and as it is an Effect, it could not bee at the first; so it should bee and yet not bee at one time: Therefore <hi>David</hi> teacheth us to say,
<hi>It is hee that made us, and not wee our selves, wee are the Sheepe of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi> for preservation, <hi>and the works of his hands,</hi> for Creation; so that <hi>Job</hi> faith, we must resolve <hi>That it was another that made all things,</hi> and that one is God.</p>
               <p>These two points, that not the World, but another, made the World and all in it, doth overthrow two errors of the Philosophers,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Opinio Stoico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
                  </note>the one was of the Stoicks, which taught <hi>quod omnia fiunt fato,</hi> as if by the revolution of things and times, at such an instant the world must needs bee, by fatall destiny and necessity, and might not bee otherwise.</p>
               <p>

               </head>
               <p>NOw are wee come to the fourth and last point which wee are to consider, in this verse, and that is, <hi>That the things which were Created by God, are both Heaven and Earth, which here is said to bee his workmanship;</hi> Which though it be here set downe in two generall things, yet are his works manifold, yea infinite and cannot be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred; All which Creatures and things Created, cannot bee better expressed then in these two, which contain all the rest, for hee so faith <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 11. <hi>In six dayes hee made Heaven and Earth, the Sea and all that is therein;</hi> So doth <hi>David</hi> expound his meaning, <hi>Psal.</hi> 146.6. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 6. therefore
<hi>Job</hi> saith, 38. 6, 7. <hi>That God made not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Starres with the Heavens, but also the Angels, or Children of God which are in them,</hi> and
<hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 1. <hi>God when hee is said to make the round World,</hi> he meaneth also, <hi>all that dwell therein,</hi> that is, <hi>Man also;</hi> yea hee is also the Lord and Creator of the Soules and Spirits of all Flesh, as well as their bodies. <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. 16. So that, to conclude with Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> by these two is understood and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all the Creatures, visible and invisible, which God made. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>For the Heavens are the bound upward, and the Earth is the bound below, which conclude all between them:</hi> Let us therefore first consider these two joyntly; then in the order wherein they stand, and in the last place severally. Touching the first, <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. 25. <hi>Thou Lord in the beginning hast laid the foundations of the Earth, and the Heavens are the worke of thy hands. Esay</hi> 40. 12. <hi>It is God that made Heaven and Earth. Job</hi> 37. 17. 18. <hi>Job.</hi> 38. 5, 6. <hi>The Heavens doe shew this, in that they resemble their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi> because they are moveable, and yet subject to alteration, and the Earth unmoveable, and not subject to motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Point.</note>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> meaning is, That not the Earth alone was made by God, <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62585:30"/>but also the Heavens, that is, both of them, and all in both, were his worke, not the Earth only but also the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; against the Philosophers, which thinke therfore that the Heavens were not made, because none can assigne the point where the Heavens began, nor in what part God began to make them, nor where the Heavens first began to move; by which reason they might hold that the heart of man was not made, because none can tell how it began its motion to pant and beat, whether by <hi>sustole</hi> or <hi>diastole,</hi> but as the heart was made, though unknown where the first motion of it is, so were the Heavens.</p>
               <p>That hee made not the Heavens only, but also the Earth below, against the errors of the Manichees, which hold that there were two causes of Heaven and Earth; That the good and white God made the Heaven, and Man from the middle upward; And the black and evill god was the efficient cause of the Earth, and of Man from the middle downward; but as Gods power and wisedome is shewed and seen as well in an <hi>Ant</hi> as in an <hi>Elephant,</hi> as one saith; as well in the creeping Wormes, and basest Creatures, as in the

<hi>That hee hath made the Heavens turn round like a wheele without an axeltree, and that hee hath caused the Earth to hang and stand without any prop to uphold it: When wee therefore consider the Heavens and Earth, the worke of thy hands,</hi> wee must needes know that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Earth are upholden by his hand.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>In respect of themselves; Heaven was made as the male part of the World, by whose influence, motion and dewes, the Earth, as the female part should, as it were out of her womb, bring forth all living and necessary things. <hi>Hermes</hi> the AEgyptian, the

               <p>Thus we have seen Gods ordinance in these words, 1. That Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth are Gods handywork: 2. That the Heavens by order are first, and first of us to be cared for: 3. The use of it which we must make, both in respect of God, of themselves, and our selves. Now out of this doctrine we frame the first article of our belief thus, God in the goodness of his fatherly love made Heaven, and Earth, and all in them: And that he might have a Creature above all others, to whom he might impart and bestow them, he made Man after his own likeness; so he made all things, <hi>non suo commodo, Job.</hi> 35. 6, 7. for we can doe him no good; neither did he give them us, <hi>nostro merito, Esay</hi> 40. 5, 6. For how could we deserve any thing, when he gave all things to us before we were, and when we were made we were but vanity; therefore it was his mere and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious goodness that brought forth Heaven and Earth for us at the beginning. <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 15. <hi>We are the blessed of the Lord, which made Heaven and Earth:</hi> So in that Psalm is distinguished the true God from all Idolls; for they cannot move, nor speak, nor doe any thing; but God did all with his word. So <hi>St. Paul,</hi> by the same reason, exhorteth the <hi>Lycaonians</hi> to turn from Idolls to the true God, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.
15. But most plainly <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 10. 11. teacheth this use to be made of the knowledge of Gods Creation. <hi>In Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie,</hi> saith he, <hi>you shall be tempted to serve their Idols;</hi> but he telleth them what answer they must make, which is written in the Caldee tongue, all the rest of the book being in Hebrew, which answer is this: <hi>Our God made Heaven and Earth, and all in them is; but your Gods can doe nothing, but their names shall vanish away, and not be heard upon the Earth.</hi> By which we see, that this maketh a plain difference between the true God of Heaven, and Idols, their names shall perish before the earth; but as our God was before the Earth was made, so the Earth and Heavens shall pass away before him, which endureth for ever. The Gentils made their gods the ofspring of Heaven &amp; Earth; but we know that Heaven and Earth are the ofspring of our God, which made all; and this is the difference to discerne the true God from the false; thus we have seen what we are to learn out of this, for the grounding of our judgment and sound knowledge, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting our understanding in the Creation.</p>

                     <hi>Usus.</hi>
                  </note>Now it remaineth to shew, out of this four points, what is to be learned for the breeding and nourishing of good motions and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in our hearts.</p>
               <p>For the first, If there was a beginning of all things, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly there will be an end.</p>
               <p>If there be a head, though the Image be never so great and tall, yet we shall come to his feet at the last, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 41, 42, 43. as the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62585:31"/>world had its seed time, that is, its beginning, and its Winter time, when it was overwhelmed with water, and its hot Summer, when God rained in it fire, so shall it have its harvest time at the last, faith Christ:
<hi>Math.</hi> 13.30. when the good shall be carried into Gods barn, and the evill into Hell fire: therefore some have well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that the Hebrew words which signifie heaven and earth, have the first letter of them Alcph, and the last letter of them Tau, to shew that they shall have an end, as they had a beginning, both in heaven and earth, so faith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.12. but as in the beginning the morning had his evening, and the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his morning: so shall it not be at the end; for then saith Saint <hi>Jude,</hi> in his Epistle, there shall be to the godly a morning of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, without any dark or dimme evening any more, <hi>vers.</hi> 21. and to the wicked an evening of utter darkness, without any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or lightness, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. that is, as the Angell sware <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.6. that as God made the beginning of time, so <hi>there should be no more time,</hi> nor course, nor order of dayes, but eternity of all; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith <hi>St. Peter, what manner of men ought we to be in all godlyness of life, seeing God made the world in love for us, and seeing there will be an end of the world, and a judgement for us.</hi> The Apostle,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 11, 12. citeth <hi>Davids</hi> saying, that <hi>the Heavens shall wax old, and be folded up as a garment,</hi> when the full number of Gods Elect are accomplished, for whom this garment and covering of heaven was made, and who doe bear up the pillers of the earth; for if it were not for the Godly and Elect in the world, neither of them could continue, <hi>Esay</hi> 51.6.
<hi>The earth also shall be wrapped up at the time:</hi> in a word, this word (<hi>Create</hi>) signifieth to begin with wisdome and judgement, and to end with justice and judgement; so, <hi>Elohim,</hi> the Creator, signifieth a Judge; and we in our name Creatures carry about us this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that we are one day to be judged.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Point.</note>The second point is, That the Creation was of nothing: then good motions and affections, which that knowledge must breed, nourish, and bring forth in us, is to make us learn to know and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our <hi>nihil,</hi> that each of us in particular are nothing, though we in pride so advance our selves here on earth, as though it seemed to us, that we were something; yea, that we were made of some more excellent things than others; as if we were not as the Publican: but saith <hi>St. Paul,</hi> If any think themselves to be ought, or if we be any thing now, let him know that this is so by God, not of himself, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5.
<hi>tametsi nibil sumus, in illo tamen sumus,</hi> therefore if we be nothing, that shall condemn us; if we be any thing, it is not that which can deserve to save us; for <hi>we are that we are, by his grace,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. And if we can acknowledge this with humilitie, then we shall know this also, to our comfort, that he which made us of nothing, can, and will, bring us to be somethings in goodness, if we serve him with humble mindes, <hi>Esay</hi> 38.3 And this is the use and fruit of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. Point.</note>The third point is, That God is our Creator whose name, <hi>Elohim,</hi> 
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62585:31"/>is fetched and derived from this Hebrew preposition <hi>el,</hi> and from the Greek preposition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, by both which God is called, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions both doe signifie <hi>per &amp; propter;</hi> to teach us, that he is our <hi>per quem,</hi> and must be our <hi>propter quem,</hi> in all our actions: therefore as it is he <hi>per quem sumus,</hi> so we must make here, his glorie and praise, the end of all our thoughts, words, actions, or devises, whatsoever. <hi>Psal.</hi> 96. 5. <hi>Elohim</hi> is said to make all, and therefore we must with praise tell it out among the Heathen: So there we are taught to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him in our youth, as our Creator; to knit our selves and our wills to him, as our Governor; and in trembling, to fear him as our Judge, <hi>for he commeth to judge the world in truth, Psal.</hi> 96. 13. for if we shall amend our lives, we shall rejoyce and wish for his comming, as we rejoyce and praise him for our making; and this is the perfection of a Christian man, <hi>contremiscere,</hi> when we think how wonderfully God hath made us, and with joy and gladness say with <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 119. 52. <hi>I remembred thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of old, and received comfort:</hi> and as we know that <hi>in him, and by him, we live, move, and have our being, Acts</hi> 17. 28. so we must live, move and breath only for him, that is, so farre forth as may make for his glorie, that at last we may with joy <hi>commend our souls to him, as to a faithfull Creator,</hi> 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4 Point.</note>The fourth point was, the things made, namely, Heaven and Earth, which comprehended all in them; that one being the upper bound above, and the other below, between both which are all: The use is, that if we look upward we see Heaven; if we cast our eyes down, the earth will be seen; for our eyes and light are given to see both, which two,
<hi>if we ask them, they will tell us, Job.</hi> 12. 7. If we will not ask them, yet they will preach and <hi>declare Gods glorie, Psal.</hi> 19. 1. that not once a week, but night and day; not for an hour in the night or day, but continually; though their preaching doe not trouble our ears, being dumb, yet they cry aloud; and though they speak not English, yet their voyce is intelligible to all Nations and Languages in the world: wherefore seeing they still cry aloud, and tell us of the Creator, that he made all these for us; it is required of us, that we be ready with our tribute and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which is to yeild due and continuall praise and thanksgiving to God for them; for heaven and Earth have a fellow feeling of the good and evill which either we doe, or God doth for us, <hi>Esay</hi> 39. 1. and they rejoyce with us, when we doe, or have any good done to us. And so when we offend God in paying our duty,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 12. then it is enough to make heaven and earth stand still and be amazed and astonished at it, because we forget God and our duty. Thus doth our sinne and ungratefullness overthrow and prevent, and stain the whole course and order of Nature, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 4. so there is a concurrent of them with us in honoring, serving, and praising the Creator, both of them and us. Therefore it is our duty and part, to give heedfull care to those preachers, which preach God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church, alwayes in silence; and so give our duty and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62585:32"/>to serve and praise God with them amongst his Saints here, that we may be glorified with them in Heaven; that we may praise and magnifie him with his Creatures in earth, that we may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with his Saints in Heaven, <hi>quod faciat Deus per Christam.</hi>

               <p>THE former verse was delivered to us an abstract of the whole work of Gods Creation: now lest we should think that when he mentioned Heaven and Earth before, he should mean that all things in Heaven and Earth were made in the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the beginning, even as we see them now; therefore

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> haste to tell us, that though at the beginning and first moment God made <hi>quecunque nunc sunt,</hi> yet he made them not <hi>qualia nunc sunt,</hi> but did that in six di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions of severall times. It had been as easie to him, to have created all things, even in the perfection and order they are, in a moment and instant, and in that beautifull form, in which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselves now to our eyes: But it pleased God, though in power he could doc it, yet in wisdome to proceed after these three degrees mentioned before. First, to create the beginning, both of all times and of all things, as the matter and beginning of all supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior bodies, and the beginning of all inferior bodies, of nothing. After the work of creation, followeth the work of distinction, from this 2. verse to the 11. And lastly ensueth the work of persection, with beauty to adorn all his works, and to finish them, which is from the 11 verse to the 16.</p>
               <p>It pleased God thus to proceed in this work; as well that he might shew himself to be the God of order; as also to discover to us the mysterie of the Trinity, in the three properties of the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which appear in the Creation; For all was made by his Power, which is the property of God the Father; By his Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is the property of God the Sonne, by which all things were orderly disposed and distinguished; And by the riches of his Goodness, which is the property of the holy Ghost, by which all things were adorned and made perfect: these three properties are remembred in the
<hi>Revel.</hi> 5. 12. and <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28.</p>
               <p>We live by his power; we, and all things, move in this order by his wisdome; and we have this our being by his grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: by his power we are taught to acknowledge him to be our beginning and originall,
<hi>ex quo sumus:</hi> by his wisdome we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be the upholder,
<hi>per quem sumus:</hi> by his goodness we confess him to be the Chief,
<hi>propter quod sumus.</hi> For, considering<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62585:32"/>his goodness, we, and all Creatures, must endeavor to doe all that we can for him, and his praise and honour. All which three are plainly and orderly set in the 11.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 36.</p>
               <p>God also took this orderly proceeding, partly that we entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the meditation of Gods works, might by this means have, as it were, a thread to direct us orderly therein: for, by this means, we come to know this difference between <hi>Creatum ordinatum, &amp; ornatum esse,</hi> as the Hebrews say, by this means we shall know, not only the beginning and being of all things, but also how orderly and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently all things were made in this Creation: And thus much of the reasons of this course of Gods proceeding in this work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> having therefore in the first verse set down the materials of the World and all in them; now to the 11. verse he sheweth the work of distinction: And after, the work of adorning and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting all.</p>
               <p>But first of all he handleth two things in this verse,
<note place="margin">The rude rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the World.</note>First what the things were he made in the beginning, before they were distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by God; for they were void and vain confused things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order or form, all covered with obscure darkness.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He sheweth how God did first order and dispose these rude things, that they might be fit for distinction and perfection. Of the first whereof at this time.</p>
               <p>In the first verse we consider God as <hi>Deum Theologicum;</hi> for it is a matter and a mysterie of Faith, that God gave all things their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of nothing: But now hereafter we shall consider him <hi>tanquam Deum Philosophicum;</hi> for there is no Philosopher, if you allow him his

                  </gap>, an understanding Spirit, which is his power and wisdome, framed all things in this order and forme, even common natural reason alloweth and admitteth this rule, because our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences doe see it, That in every excellent work, the action must by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degrees and spaces come to perfection; for before fire can burn any other things, it must first warm, then by little and little make black, and parch and scorch the combustible thing, &amp; after that, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flameth it, and at last maketh it perfectly of its fiery nature, able to doe that to another thing which the fire did to it at the first; so every cause, by an orderly course of proceeding, doth bring his effect to perfection</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> sheweth therefore, that God took that course which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable to natural reason; and therefore first setteth down the imperfection of all things at their first beginning, and then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees by which they come to their perfection: For at the first there was a foggie gross darkness; after, he made the dawning or morning, which is a mixture of some light and some darkness; And after, he made the perfect light. So at the first he sheweth touching the waters, that they were a bottomless gulfe; afterward, he made them quiet waters; and at last, made them salt Seas and fresh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Fountains and Springs, in most necessary and orderly sort. And for the Earth, first the beginning of them (which were the matter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62585:33"/>of all earthly things) it was a desolate and disordered, rude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed mass, covered with water; After, God set it above the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and made it dry ground, as the word signifieth; And at the last he brought it to its perfection, making it fruitfull and sanctifying it in all necessary things: In the handling of which, we will first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally behold them together, and then severally and apart.</p>
               <p>Touching the first, It is even as if he had said, all things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth were not, at the beginning, in that comely and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect order and manner, in which you behold them now: for now they present themselves to our eyes well fashioned, adorned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished; but then they were without form, unshapely, and void. So the waters now we see, serve for Navigation above, and within them they are most profitable and fruitfull in bringing innumerable store of fith; but at the beginning it was made void, rude, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: Now we see the Heavens beautified and adorned with stars and lights; but at the beginning it was but a gross mist and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed darkness, without any light: Wherefore one calleth them the swadling Clouts of the Worlds infancie, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.6. for the Waters overspread and covered all the Earth, and <hi>the mist of darkness, Job</hi> saith, <hi>was the swadling band of the World,</hi> 38.9. So the Cloudes were the swadling Clouts of the World, in which it was wrapt up; and the Seas were his Swathes, to binde and swadle it up in its best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie.</p>
               <p>As the Worlds Creation was of nothing, in the work of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction all things were next kin to nothing; for that without was rude and confused, and within is void and emptic of any good, is as a thing of nothing, and such were all things saith <hi>Moses.</hi> The Earth being distinguished from the Waters was somthing indeed, but yet so dry and unprofitable, that it was to no purpose nor use for any thing to dwell and remain on it.</p>
               <p>Now we see the earth is set first, if <hi>Moses</hi> had observed a curious order, he should have placed heaven before earth, as in the
1. &amp; 6. but the manner of the holy Ghost in the scripture, is alwayes to begin to speak of that which is freshest in memory, and that is commonly, that which one speaketh of last.</p>
               <p>The earth is called <hi>Toba, Tobohu,</hi> which hath this signification that it was a thing without shew, in sight misshapen and deformed to outward view, and within to have no inward vertue of good substance, to make amends; for <hi>Tohu,</hi> signifieth a thing misshapen without, and
<hi>Tobohu</hi> signifieth a thing wanting all goodnesse, and substance within, to make amends for that; and so it signifieth a thing of no commendation or value. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which are <hi>Tohu,</hi> that is, deformed without, as <hi>Elisha</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 2. 23. who was mocked and derided of the boyes in the street, but yet within he had inward vertues, which made amends for his outward want.</p>
               <p>And there are some things which are <hi>Tobohu,</hi> that is, void and wanting all inward substance, and good stuffing within, without
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62585:33"/>are very goodly and fair in shew to look too, as
<hi>Absolon</hi> which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, was a man without blemish, but within he had no good stufting answerable to that without, but rather fraught with pride, murder, and disobedience.</p>
               <p>But the earth was both <hi>Tohu</hi> and <hi>Tobohu,</hi> without deformed, and within void and empty, not that it had no form, for that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reason, but it was such a form as was altogether deformed; for there is, <hi>forma <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp; forma perfectionis,</hi> and this defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med form it had which made it loathed, having nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it; it had as the prophet <hi>Esay</hi> 34. 11. speaketh, line of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and the stones of emptinesse, threatning to make wicked Cities such deformed things, that is, he will make them like the world at this state, a confused head, and the stones of the heap shall not be sound stones, but unprofitable rubbish fit for no use. Thus we see what the earth was at the beginning.</p>
               <p>Now God in proceeding did replenish and fill that voyd empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which it had, with all good things which it wanted, and beautified the deformity of it in this most glorious form, as now we see, and better shall perceive hereafter: so that it is evident, that both the fulnesse of things, with which now it is replenished, and this beauty which it hath, it then wanted.</p>

               </p>
               <p>First, touching the authority of the precept, we see it was God that said it, <hi>dicere autem,</hi> faith <hi>

               <p>Touching the first, it were absurde to say, that God should speak after the manner of men, with an audible sound of words, for it were in vain and to no end, to speak when there were none to hear: therefore this is that which we must conceive of it, that when God speaketh to us in his word, he doth it, as it were, in our dialect, that is, so as we may understand what he meaneth, for if he should speak properly of himself, we are not able to comprehend the manner of his works, therefore as the Holy Ghost taketh a name, and title from a Dove, so doth God
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> borrow his manner of doing from a Prince, which is the greatest thing we can conceive, for what is in our conceit (more forceable to the speedy execution and through dispatch of a thing) then a Princes streight commandement, and mandate, which on a sodain can cause whole Armies of men to be ready at his pleasure.</p>
               <p>Men doe unfold and manifest their walls and counsells in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by word of their mouthes: <hi>Sicut voluntas sermo ejus, it a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra opus ejus,</hi> faith one, his word is his will, and all the frame of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is his work, proceeding therefrom. Wherefore, in that it is said <hi>God spake,</hi> it is meant, that he plainly revealed and meant to declare his will.</p>
               <p>This uttering and revealing the will is after two sorts, which the two Hebrew words doe signifie. First when a man, by a secret discourse doth reason or speak in his heart, which doth reason off the audible sound of words,
<hi>Preach.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>I in my heart purposed with my self;</hi> so <hi>the fool spake in his heart,</hi> that he durst not utter by sound of voyce,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 1. So there is a double word speaking, the one is <hi>verbum vocis,</hi> the other <hi>cordu</hi> But to speak truly and properly, there is but one word, which is in our hearts; as our word is first cloathed with aire, and so becommeth audible to mens eares; so faith one, Christ, the word of his Father, being cloathed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, was visible and manifest to all men: So to conclude, the word is that he conceived first in the Closer, as I may say, of his

               <p>And here we may learn the difference between us and God: In us there is one thing by which we are, and another thing by which we understand and conceive things; but in God both his being and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding are of one and the same substance: And this substantial Word of God, is that where with
<hi>St. John</hi> beginneth his Gospell. God created that which was not, but

<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. and therefore he is called, <hi>the brightness of his Fathers glorie:</hi> So at what time God was, at that time the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Sonne appeared and shone from him.

Therefore first he brought forth light, as his sunne: But some, having little Philosophie in them, doe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against this work of God very impiously, as if it were not to be said, that light was made three dayes before the Sunne, which is the cause thereof. But if we respect God, the Father of lights, or the Sunne, which is the light of the World, or the necessity of light, for <hi>Lux est vox verum,</hi> because that which things cannot express by voyce and words, they doe plainly shew by the comming of light, which manifesteth all things. Again, God being about the work of distinguishing, it was necessary, first to make the great distiuguisher of all things, which is light; for <hi>in nocte est color omnibus idem, &amp; tenebrae rerum discrimina tollunt,</hi> but the light distinguisheth one thing from another. Again, of the three beginnings, we shew that the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was of time, but we could not have a morning to make a first day, without light of it was first made; for the naturall common Clock of the world, to distinguish times, is the course of light and darkness, which is the essence of day and night. Furthermore, we have seen that the Heavens were the first and most excellent: therefore the light, being the first quality and affection of the the Heavens, the first body made, must by right order be made first. Last of all, we begin naturally, <hi>a communionibus,</hi> but there is nothing with which all things doe more commonly communicate, than the light of the Son: <hi>ergo,</hi> it is first, for it is the communication of Heaven, because all the<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62585:36"/>Starres doe borrow their light of it, and we see by it on earth; it is <hi>oculus noster,</hi> by which we see, and it is their Cresset to light all them.</p>
               <p>There are some which will have a reason of Gods works, and would know how it could be that light should be first made, and four daies after the Sunne to be made, which was the cause of it: But to these, I answer, that their absurd doubt, doth argue small skill in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy: for they speak, as if the light were an affection and quality only of the Sunne; for we see that the fire on earth, the meteors and lightnings in heaven, the scales of Fishes, and a dark wood, have also light in them: And what doth give light to these? I answer, not the Sunne; But admit the same were the cause of light, yet we see that many things have their proceeding in nature before things on which they have, after, their dependance: As all agree that the livor in a man, hath the precedence in nature, and yet after it hath his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the heart as his chief; for though the light hath now his dependance on the Sunne, yet then it had his precedence. And as Christ was long before he took the body of Flesh: so was the light a certain time before it took, and was joyned, to the body of the Sunne. Again we may say, that though the Sunne was not created now, yet the substance of the Sunne was now made, and so we may understand <hi>lux</hi> for
<hi>corpus lucidum,</hi> which after was perfected.</p>
               <p>Last of all, this of <hi>St. Basill</hi> will overthrow their doubt: For if a man will grant to God, that he made all things, without matter, of nothing: then we must also grant that he can make light without the Sunne; for God doth not depend upon ordinary means; he is not bound and tyed to the Sunne, that by the means thereof, light should shew; for he can give light without it three dayes, by miracle, at the beginning, and will for ever give light without the Sunne, after the end of the world. The Hebrews spake of three Creations. <hi>1. De nihilo: 2. In nihilo: 3. Super nihilum:</hi> All things were of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the light was in nothing, <hi>the earth hanged upon nothing, Job.</hi> 26. 7. Tell me, saith <hi>Job,</hi> on what the earth dependeth; and I will tell thee on what the light then did depend, for it was miraculously, giving light without Sunne.</p>
               <p>A word of the second point, <hi>Job</hi> telleth, that it is a probleme, and a hard question, to know from whence the light is, <hi>Job</hi>
38. 19. and in the 24. verse, That it is more than mans wisdome to answer it, for the very light is darknesse, and ignorance to us, for all that reason can conceive of it, is this, that either it must needs be a substance, or else

                  </gap> God gave not the light to the Moon, but to us, that the light might arise to us. The reference that this verse hath with that which goeth before, is this: God made things before; and here <hi>Moses</hi> sheweth the quality of it, that it was even in Gods judgement very good and perfect, that is, as the Philosophers say, God in all his works limiteth together <hi>bonum &amp; ens;</hi> for all that he maketh is passing well made,
<note place="margin">The difference between Gods works and ours</note>which sheweth the difference between Gods works and ours: For it is our manner, so we doe a thing that God willeth, or that we purpose, it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we care not how it be done: But here God teacheth us by his example, that we should in attempting any thing, have a speciall care that it be good, and welldone: Also it is usuall with us, that the thing we make in haste is, as we say, <hi>canis festinans,</hi> that is, it is rudely and blindely done; and therefore that which a man will doe well, he taketh great pains and leasure about it, because it is a hard and difficult matter to doe a thing well; but God doth, and can doe things well, and perfectly well, with ease, with quick dispatch, even in a moment, with great facility and celerity, and yet we see, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it to be very good in these words:
<note place="margin">Two parts: the View, and Confirmation to be good.</note>Therefore there are two parts; First, the view which God taketh, in beholding the light: Secondly, his testimony, affirming and confirming it to be good.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The View.</note>Touching the first, As before we haveheard of Gods speaking, so here now we are to consider of Gods seeing. Touching both<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62585:37"/>which, <hi>Moses,</hi> by Gods spirit, is taught to speak after the manner of men, in our phrase and dialect, that it might be to our capacity; for he cannot <hi>speak to us as to spirituall, but as to carnall men,</hi> for our fleshly understanding, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1. It is said, that God spake familiarly to <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 33. 11. that is plainly, both touching the matter, and also for the phrase and manner of his speech: My meaning is, that <hi>Moses</hi> seemeth to tell us, that God did, as men use to doe; which, when they have done any worke, they will after return to it and take a view thereof, and look on it, that if any thing be amiss, he may mend it, and to the end he may allow and approve of it, if it be well and according to his minde. So God, after the same manner, is said to doe here: having made the light, he considered of it; and seeing it according to his minde and liking, he expresseth his love, liking and allowing of it. Wherefore it is as much to say, as <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit Deo:</hi> for as his word <hi>fiat lux</hi> expressed his Counsell and secret purpose, which it pleased and liked him to determine to bring to pass; so now this approbation expresseth his good pleasure, that it should continue and abide to our good use and benefit: So that God is not like the potter, which sometime having made a pot, doth not like it, but breaketh it again; but God will have his work continue, and therefore doth authorise it to be good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 4. We set our eyes upon things that are good and beautifull; so when God is said to like any thing, it is said that he looked and beheld it, yea, and that he smelleth also to it, as a pleasant thing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 21.</p>
               <p>The use, fruit, and profit of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Doctrine is of two sorts.</p>
               <p>The first is in respect of our minds and affections. The second in respect of our actions and practise. For our judgement, it teacheth us to know that <hi>Deus vidit,</hi> that is, we are the work of his hands, and he doth behold and consider us and our doings, whether they be good <hi>Gen.</hi>
16. 14. God is there called <hi>Deus vivens &amp; videns,</hi> and
<hi>Job.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>nos indies visitar,</hi> that is, he doth see us often every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he doth visit us, for that is a frequentative of seeing; so that he by his providence and care doth behold and visit us and our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings continually, not only when it is morning, and in the light, but also in secret and in the dark and hidden places, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 12. for the darkness is no darkness to him, <hi>the night and day light to him are both alike;</hi> yea, the 16. vers of that Psalm, God saw <hi>David</hi> when he was secretly in his mothers wombe; if we could dig down into hell he seeth us there,
<hi>Amos</hi> 9. 2. if we fly to the uttermost parts and corners of the earth, there he is and seeth us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 8.9.10. <hi>sive lucerna ardet, videt te; sive extincta est, videt te,</hi> saith one; there is nothing so hid but that he knoweth it, and he will reward it openly, be it good,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 4. 6. 18, or bad, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 12. Then this that God watcheth and seeth hath relation to these two ends; He look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on it, that if it be good it may please and delight him, and so he may be moved therewith to save and preserve and commend us and our actions; but if he seeth it evill, it is his intent to condemn, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and destroy it and us. Thus we see Gods view is profitable for<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62585:37"/>our thoughts and judgment to know his approbation or reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The second sort, is for our practise: for God is said in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to doe many things, that we may doe like and resemble our Father: If God look on his, and our works, much more it is our duty and behoveth us to doe the like: If he be grieved, and sorrowfull, and repent, when he seeth our works evill; how much more doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to doe the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Examen in mente est quod visas in oculo.</hi> Therefore we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider often of our doings, to see whether they be good or bad, which thing is contrary and against a humor of ours; for when we have done any thing, we never consider whether it be good or bad, we have no regard of it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the Prophets oftentimes beat upon this exhortation,
<hi>Vadite in cor vestrum.</hi> Consider your own doing in your hearts,
<hi>Esay</hi> 46.8. <hi>Preach.</hi> 2.12. The wise man, often saith, that he returned to consider the fruit and labor of his hands, to see the vanity or good of them: And if we thus consider our waies and works, whether they be good or evill, and repent, or rejoyce, approve or disprove them, then we doe, like Children, imitate our Father: If God return to behold his light, how much more should we return to see and consider of our works of darknesse, and to acknowledge with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, how evill they are; It is our custome and fashion, if we doe any thing for our inferiors (as God doth here) not to regard it; wherefore seeing he doth carefully consider and regard the things he maketh for us, being so base as worms, how much more doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us, doing things for him that is our Creator, to doe the like? For if we doe any thing for a Prince or a Noble man, what great care and pains, and consideration doe we take in doing and viewing, that it may be well? wherefore much more must we doe in our works, for him who is King of Kings.</p>
               <p>Last of all, touching the use: If God were so carefull to look to this work, which could bring no gain or profit to him at all, then how much more doth it concern us, to look to our works, which we doe to him, seeing to them is great reward promised? <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.14. he did his
<hi>gratis,</hi> without any hope of reward, but we have promise and hope of reward for our well doing; and therefore it behoveth us to behold and see that our works be good; which we shall the rather doe, if we consider the seldomnesse of our attempting any good, and the sillynesse of our well doings, when they are at the best; for God every day doth many good things perfectly for us, but we scarce doe any good once in a week, yea, not one good thing, though never so unperfect, to a thousand sinnes, which therefore must humble us, and make us look to our works.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lux er at bona.</hi>
                  </note>Now we are to consider the goodnesse of this creature <hi>Light.</hi> Touching which, this is the generall regard and rule of Divinity. <hi>Nemo bonus est nisi Deus, Mark</hi> 10.18. therefore if any man, or any thing created, be good, or have any goodnesse ascribed to it, we must<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62585:38"/>know that it was derived from God, which is the fountain of all goodnesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.
2. for goodnesse is his garment, and we are naked and destitute of it, until he doth cast the lap of his own gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over us. Light is good, because God made it, and partaketh the quality from God. For it is impious to think that any thing in the World should be evill, defective or imperfect, (and therefore not commendable) and the cause and fault of it not to be in the matter of which it was made, but of the efficient which made it; But if any thing be good, perfect and commendable, the cause of it is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the maker, not of the matter: for the matter of all things is nothing, or a thing rude and unperfect, and therefore of it can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed nothing of worth. In mens works, if the matter whereof we make things, were as permanent and durable as the form, which the work-man setteth to it, our works would be long and very lasting; for we see, that if the matter of a house or garment would continue, and were perfect, the form and fashion of it would continue, and not decay; but because the matter is ruinous and subject, the one to be rotten, and the other to be thread-bare. Therefore our works can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not last, so all the defects and imperfections, both of Body and Soul, doe come from the defects of the matter, of which we were made, not of the form in which God made us: from thence therefore had <hi>Adam</hi> and his posterity, an ability and possibility, to be subject to return to emptinesse, to darknesse, and to deformity, to be without goodnesse and full of evill, because he was made of the rude matter, which was so: But if any good thing remain in us, it is because of the relicks of that form in which God made us. Thus much of goodnesse in generall: now for a more particular consideration of the goodnesse of light: We see that God first praiseth that, which indeed causeth all other things to be praised, and therefore it must needs be good and most commendable.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God is the <hi>testis</hi> and witnesse, which affirmeth it to be so: Who dare deny it?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, yea who can deny it, for our own eyes being judg and witnesse, we must needs also, with God say, it is good, for it hath
<hi>aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctabilem in se bonitatem;</hi> yea it is a means by which we see how good God is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 8. Behold and see how good God is. Goodnesse hath two respects, the one is in regard of it self, the second in respect of others; when it is good to other things, and in asmuch as it doth good, and delighteth others besides it self, by communication of his quality to others; And hereunto ariseth the threefold distinction of <hi>bonum,</hi> which all Philosophers gaze at, and speak of so much. The first, is, <hi>bonum honestum.</hi> Second, <hi>bonum jucundum.</hi> Third, <hi>bonum utile,</hi> all which doe much differ. <hi>Psal.</hi> 133. 1. unity and amity of brethren, is <hi>bonum atque jucundum. Titus</hi> 3. 8. many things may be <hi>bonum, utile &amp; jucundum,</hi> but this light is good in all respects, <hi>

                     </gap>
                  </hi> 47 3. <hi>verse.</hi> For the first, That is good, which is desired in, and for it self, as <hi>Eve</hi> therefore desired the Apple, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. but we desire to see the light only for it self, <hi>propter videre lumen;</hi> and therefore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62585:38"/>having no pleasant object at all: Yet we still love to have our eyes open, because it is good to see and behold the light of the Sunne. Also all good things and vertues are in a league of great affinity, friendship, and amity with the light, which argueth that it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like it in goodness, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 9. 17. 22. <hi>veritas non quaerit angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi> for truth feareth and hateth nothing more then to be kept and imprisoned in darkness; and all evill things cannot abide the light, but hate it as deadly, because light is contrarie to their evill nature; but honest and good things delight in the light.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is delightfull for others to behold, as the apple,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. as well as <hi>Bonum in se;</hi> for we count it a miserable thing to eate our meat in darkness though our meat be good,
<hi>Preach.</hi> 11. 7. and 5. 6. <hi>It is a pleasant thing to see the Sunne, Preach.</hi> 11. 7. Blindness is an uncomfortable thing, as <hi>Tobie</hi> confesseth, yea such things as have not sufficient light, are less comfortable and delightfull; for the house which hath little store of light, we finde fault withall as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and uncomfortable: Therefore it hath a nature to be comely also and amiable or beautifull, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 1. <hi>Lux habet venusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> it is sightly for the pleasure of the eye, and therefore is called <hi>mater pulchritudinis,</hi> the colours that have most brightness and light in them, are best liked, and so are the silks which have the greatest and fairest gloss. But without light there is no beauty, the eye is without pleasure or delight in any object; for in the dark a russet coat and a scarler robe is all one; no difference between a ruinous Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon and a princely Pallace: Therefore in this degree of good, light is very good.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, touching the profit of it, Which <hi>utile</hi> also caused the desire of the Apple, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. light is very profitable and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, both in matters of expediencie, and also in things of necessity; for all our knowledge cometh of light, and is compared to light,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 8.9. In <hi>Job.</hi> 37. 22. it is compared to gold, both
<hi>propter venustatum, utilitatem, &amp; necessitatum;</hi> and if you will know through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the price, value, and estimation of it, then see the value and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the eye; for one would rather lose all his gold and treasure for a ransome, than depart from one eye, for that did grieve Israel most, 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2. and why should one make any reckoning of his eyes, if it were not for the light? for without it, our eye and our nose can see both alike: yea, we have no use, but trouble of it, without light; we may know and consider the price of light by this, that in the night, which is a naturall absence of light, rather than we will sit in the dark and want the benefit of light, we will redeem and buy it with money, and some know what cost some are at in buying of light. Out of this consideration ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth matter of meditation, both for our profit and amendment of life. And first it sheweth the condemnation and rebuke of three faults, in three sorts of men: For we say that the action which crosseth Gods action, is very ill; but the judgment and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which crosseth, contradicteth, and denieth Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62585:39"/>and approbation of a thing, is farre worse:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God, when he saw the light, said it is good:</hi> How dare any person be so ill, as when he seeth the light, to say it is evill? Yet there are three sorts of men which doe thus. It is a usuall thing, in the sale of such Wares and Merchandise which are adulterate, evill, and corrupt, men will say this light is evill, it is not good for us what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God saith; and therefore they doe frame and make false and deceiveable lights. But seeing the light, the brighter it is, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is, they which will sell good and lawfull Merchandise, must not make to themselves dimme and deceiveable lights; for seeing this visible light is good, we must not call light darkness, nor good evill, <hi>Esay</hi> 5. 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In regard of the light of grace we see, as
<hi>Job</hi> saith that there are some which are <hi>Lucifugae,</hi> which fly and hate the light, such Creatures are unclean, <hi>Levit.</hi> 11. 19. 30. as Batts and Owles among birds, Moules and Rats among Beasts, they are odious to all men; so among places, Dungeons and darksome Roomes are odious also. And as this is so, in things natural; so, in things spiritual, <hi>lucifugae actiones,</hi> are of the like evill nature and odious to God and good men; because both such men, and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, have an opposition to light, and the author of light. They come from darkness of the minde, that is, ignorance and unbelief, and they are begotten by the Prince of darkness the Divell,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 12. and in the end they goe to utter darkness, and therefore they are called <hi>the works of darkness, Rom.</hi> 13. 12. And so no marveil though they love darkness and hate light, if any cannot abide the light of Gods word to be reproved by it, as Herctiques and Hypocrites, such dig deep pits to hide their Counsells, <hi>Esay</hi> 29, 15. because they see <hi>the light is to them evill, and as the shadow of death, Job.</hi> 24. 17. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiness of good things, and the bottomlesnesse of ill things, and the deformity of both, proceedeth and commeth from darknesse, and was inclosed in it, as we have seen in it: And so spiritually is all found in the ignorance of the truth,

Wherefore we see God made light first, before any other good: And so our selves must receive spiritual light of knowledge before he will give us any better grace.</p>
               <p>The third sort of men are catchers and fault finders with Gods Creatures; such which think to know how Gods works, which now are good, might have been farre better, as if God might have done well to have craved their counsell and help; but Gods works both in particular and general, are so good and perfect, that they could not be mended. Wherefore, if the light seem ill for us, we must confesse and acknowledge, that the fault is not in Gods work, but in the illnesse and infirmity of our eyes and understanding: If the Word seem evil to us, know that it seemeth so to us, because we and our works are evil, and therefore cannot abide the light, <hi>John</hi> 3. 20.</p>

Fourthly, ensued the essence and being of all creatures, they were prepared by the Spirit, and perfected by the word of God: where we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, first, the essence and being of light, and then the nature of it: And lastly, of all the goodnesse of the light, both in regard of the presence of God, who in his counsell thought it to be good, and also after the creation by his approbation, allowed the use and continuance of it unto us.</p>
               <p>Now followeth, the distinction and dividing, which giveth yet a degree of perfection to the former light, more than it had before; for at the first, he gave light such a being, which should <hi>prodire in actum,</hi> and not every being, but a speciall good being, which is a degree further, of order and distinction, against disorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, to be in all respects laudible, and that not every good being, but that which is more, an ordered, and distinguished, and comely good being, which work of all other is the perfection of Creation, as we shall see in the rest: for things though they be never so good in them selves, as <hi>St. Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.
7. of another thing in the like case, yet they cannot be discerned of men to be so, neither are they meet for any good use of men, unlesse they have a certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction and order.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Order.</note>Therefore order is, as some say, very goodnesse of goodnesse it self, for there are many good things, which doe cease from being good to us, yea become hurtfull being without the rank, order and degree, either of their set and distinct place or time: As fire though it be good in the Chimney, yet it is not good, nay it is very evill in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62585:40"/>the top of the house. Fire is very good in the Winter to warm us, but in the Summer it is not so good, but shunned of men: So the light not being tempered and proportioned orderly, but being any degree too-bright, it hurteth and blindeth our eyes, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.6, 11.
<hi>Excellens objectum corrumpit sensum:</hi> So the fire being in any degree too fierce, and too hot in the Chimney (and Winter) that is, not moderated, and ordered in a good degree, it doth us no good. Wherefore we see, that a set and a distinct order must be observed in good things, both touching the place, time, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; And that the contrarie, inordination, deordination, or want of order in these things, which is called <hi>Babell</hi> hereafter, that is a confusion, maketh things to cease from being good to us, which in their own nature are very good. It was necessary therefore, that God should proceed to this work of distinction, as he in wisdome doth: This then is as if
<hi>Moses</hi> had said, the light was good; for else <hi>extingueret, non distingueret Deus si non esset bonum,</hi> he would not else have distinguished it, but dashed it in peeces and destroyed it again.</p>
               <p>Therefore because it was good he separated it and set it apart from darknesse, by it self:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lonum &amp; malum in Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra arguit quid Creator &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria corum erat.</hi>
                  </note>Which thing doth teach us, that all things created, be they never so good, they carry in them, as well a mark and signe of the matter whereof they were made, as of the Creator who made them, that is, as by some goodnesse in them they shew the excellencie of their maker, in some part, so by some ill and vicious quality in them, they bewray the imperfection and rudenesse of the matter of which they came. As for example, Corn hath his chaff with it, Light hath adjoyned his contrarie, darknesse, Honey bringeth his unsavory wax, Metals have their drosse, and Liquors and Wines their lees and dreggs, the one sheweth the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the maker, the other the rudenesse, deformity, and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the matter. Now then we see, that untill there be a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and separation between the lees, grounds or drosse of the Wine or Beer, and untill a tryal be made to refine and put apart and try the drosse from the pure Metal, and sift the chaff and sever it from the Wheat and Corne, we can have no good and sit use pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for us and convenient. Even so we say of the Light; for according to the course of this mixt world, light was brought forth in his mixture, that is, in darknesse, <hi>John</hi> 1.5. Therefore as God doth here try and discover, and separate light from darknesse, so in <hi>Math.</hi> 3.12. he is a Fanner and Winnower of the chaff from the Wheat, and by separation cleanseth his floare, leaving there only the Children of light.</p>

Wherefore, as emptinesse is nothing but a want and defect of stuffing and fullnesse; and as nakednesse is nothing but a want of cloaths and covering; and as silence is nothing but a withholding of words and speech:

So the Divell shuffleth good things to bad, that there may be an equality between them, which should have no coherence, which is <hi>mater confusionis,</hi> as he is author and <hi>pater confusionis.</hi> Wherefore this must teach us to divide, as God doth things of different and contrary nature.</p>
               <p>As for the division it self, the manner of it is after four sorts:
<note place="margin">1.</note>For, first, he devided them in cause, for the bright and fair, clean, bodies, as fire have their <hi>fulgorem, Ezech.</hi> 1. 4. and is the cause of it, the firmament hath his
<hi>splendorem,</hi> and is the cause of it. So he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them, that so he might appoint these to be the causes of light to the World. So <hi>e contra</hi> he did it, that these <hi>corpora opaca,</hi> these thick and compact bodies should give a shaddow, and so be the cause of darknesse: so God divided them first that they might be divers causes of these.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, he hath divided them in places; when the light is in the upper Hemisphere with us, the darknesse is by division cast into the lower Hemisphere with the Antipodes: And so God hath set his horizon Circle, as a girdle about the middest of the Earth, <hi>Job</hi>
28. 20. which is a lymit and bound of this division, to leave darknesse, that it come no nearer the light, then that.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, in time; For as this very, part of time with us is light, so to some in the afternoon at this very hour, it will be darknesse and night; for as now by Gods separation, light doth drive out dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so then the light shall give place to the dark; and so shall the course of times continue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Fourthly, in regard of the use, of which we spake before, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 23. For he divided them thus, in the one we might have time to labour and work, and in the other to rest and sleep: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the light is called the window, by which we see what to doe, and night the curtain to draw over it, when we are weary and would take rest; and as this is the temporall use, of this alteration of light and darknesse, which God hath made: so there is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall use for which he did it, and that is, he separated the one from<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62585:41"/>the other, that the light might be the inheritance of his Saints in light, in regard of which God

But that light which God dwelleth in, and we shall, is such which hath no darknesse at all, <hi>John</hi> 1. 5. And this is our reward, which are the Children that walk in light; but for the wicked, he hath reserved another eternall use of darknesse, even <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liginem tenebrarum,</hi> which grosse part of darknesse, is in this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction cast down into the bottomlesse deep of Hell, for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked, as that is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<note place="margin">Hell.</note>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hell is said to be in that place of emptinesse or below, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 1.

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> we begin to be good.</p>
               <p>Thus we see God is our pattern for imitation, to teach us to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and distinguish good and evill. Touching our selves first, which thing Gods word also resembling, God himself doth teach us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.
10. For it discerneth and separateth the will in the hearts and thoughts of men, aswell as in actions, and setteth his mark on them, saying to us, this is evill, avoid it, this is good, receive it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Two things in light.</note>There are two things in light, which are the marks and notes of his goodnesse by which it is known, that is, brightnesse and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse. So Gods Spirit is called the light and oyle of knowledge, for knowledge, instruction, and direction, and in the 45. <hi>Psal.</hi> 7. He is called the oyle of gladnesse and comfort and consolation, so Gods<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62585:42"/>word is a lanthorne, and also a joy and comfort, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 105. but <hi>e contra</hi> ignorance and darknesse is melancholy and uncomfortable. So we may make our marke of distinction on things; for if we see them uncomfortable to the soul and conscience, set a mark on it, that knowing them, we may eschue such things, and ensue such things as are good and comfortable. And thus much for our selves.</p>
               <p>Now touching others, we learn also that in Common-wealths the Magistrate must have his stone of Tynne, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 10. that is, his marking stone, for that is the word also here, to set his mark of difference on the evill, to discover them from the good. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister hath belonging to him only vision to discern them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 19. but the Magistrate hath division to doe it; so that he may by deed approve and commend the good, and reprove and condemn the bad; and if all did keep this difference, the world would be a light world; but because the good and the evill, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction or regard, are shuffled together, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 1. this confusion in Common-wealths is the cause, by Gods just judgement, of the confusion and renting a sunder of Common-wealths and Churches, <hi>Dan.</hi>
5.18. This just division then looked to in the Governor, would avoid confusion in the popular sort, as God doth here begin to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish light from darknesse, so doth he the same continually by his word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. separating and marking the works of darknesse from the armour of light; for it sheweth to us, daily, which are ignorant and negligent, these things are evill, and not to be done; that is good, and must be done; these things the ignorant Gentills and Infidells did; therefore thou must not doe the like, which hast knowledge: these things doe they which are desparate and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of comfort; therefore thou, which hast peace and joy with God must not doe so.</p>
               <p>Thus we must be carefull in separating evill from good, untill the great day of separation, when God shall sever all evill from good for ever; for here God is a Fisher, and Common-wealths and Churches are as a Net, which hath in them good and bad together, children of light and darknesse, but then at the last day of separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when a full, finall, and perfect distinction shall be made, all shall not be taken into Gods Boat, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 32. but the good fish only shall be taken into Gods Boat, and the evill shall be cast away. Then God will be a Sheepherde, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 32. and divide the Sheep from the Goats for ever, setting this eternall marke <hi>venite Benedicti, ite Maleaicti.</hi> Untill the last day of perfect separation, there will be still confusion and disorder, both in private men and publique Weales, but they which cease not to confound themselves in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, Justice with unrighteousnesse, <hi>qui confundunt, confundentur,</hi> Thus we have seen the order of separation in God; also the manner of it in us, both privately and publickly; And what confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion will be unto the last day. And thus much of the natural sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the spiritual use thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:62585:43"/>Now as here we see <hi>divisio rerum,</hi> so in the next place is set down <hi>divisio nominum &amp; denominationum,</hi> which ever ensueth the other, for it is the sinne of the world not to divide things in their denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and names which are perfectly and plainly distinguished in their natures; for they call repentance and remorse sullennesse and melancholy, and <hi>Davids</hi> spiritual joy foolishnesse, covetousnesse they call honest thrift, profuseness providence, and riot liberality, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience they call cowardlinesse, and quarrelling manhood, light dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and darknesse light: So they confound the names, when they cannot the natures: But such shall give account for it, to the great distinguisher in the great last day of division.</p>
               <p>We have in this distinction many things to consider, as, The names given, The Athcists objection, And sundry other matters, of which the next time.</p>

               <p>AFTER God had distinguished and divided light from darknesse, as being things in nature oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, and in degree unequall, which contrariety and inequality, not being separated, are the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of all confusion. Now he proceedeth to divide them in name; for as the natural division serveth for all things, so this distinction of deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and names, in respect of us men, serveth for our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to distinguish them, which inducement moveth us to think that God had respect to mankinde even from the beginning in all things that he created, as if he purposed to make them for men; for though light and darknesse affecteth all Creatures, even beasts, yet the name and title given to them concerneth only man, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth and discerneth things by their names; and therefore as soon as he made man, he gave him a gift to know by what names to call and distinguish one thing from another, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 19. for God hath in the Creation ordained things that they should be known, and that they might be known, he giveth names of distinction, which are <hi>symbola rerum,</hi> as it were, notes to know them by; and because we cannot in this life know all that God made, we look for a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer light after this life, by which our knowledge shall be perfect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12.</p>
               <p>Touching this division of names, we have four things to consider, First, the manner of denominations: Secondly, the cause: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ende: Fourthly, the dependance of the day on the light, and not on the Sunne, as some say.</p>
               <p>Touching the first, that is, Whether God called them by their names and imposed titles to them after a sensible manner, with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct audible voyce, I finde a double contrariety in Writers; But,<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62585:43"/>to resolve upon it, To whom should he speak audibly, seeing there was none to hear and understand? And therefore to no end and purpose should we think, he should speak so, but as the Hebrew say <hi>appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, id est fecit appellari,</hi> the same phrase, as we say Princes doe build houses, that is, doe cause them to be builded: wherefore the manner of giving names is this, that as God gave before the naturall use of things, so now he took order that we might have a use of them by names, to know and talke of them so.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>God is the cause and author of the names of things, by which we know and call them; for though we say, that when God created man, he made him capable of speech &amp; of language, in which language we see God had speech and conference with him, being made,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16, 17,18. Yet <hi>Adam</hi> imposed not the names to the Creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 19. but according to that gift of knowledge and utterance, he calleth things by such names and titles as he had received from God; for as God did <hi>largiri linguam,</hi> so he did <hi>nominibus praeire linguae;</hi> for here we see before ever man was made, in all the six dayes works, God gave names to the things as he made them, and to <hi>Adam</hi> himself, and in these seven things named, are contained all other particular things made in, and with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>The end, to which God gave &amp; imposed sundry names was, that we should doe as he hath done, that is, when things have a true being, then to give names to them accordingly, and not to our fancies, and things which indeed are not at all, as the custome of the World is for things that have no <hi>esse,</hi> as the Hebr. said, must have no name: For God gave names to things that were created, and had a being:
<note place="margin">☜</note>We must not then doe as the Apothecaries, that is, set on their Boxes a name and title of a precious thing, when within it there is no such matter; we must not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the name of Learning, Godlinesse and Light, nor give it to others, when we know our selves and they to be darkned and evill. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when things have a true being, we have a care to give names and titles, agreeable to the nature and quality of them, that the act and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, may be made manifest in the name of it, as written in the forehead: for as a man draweth good Liquor out of the Cask, so out of the meaning and signification of the Word, and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations given by God, we may draw out the hidden nature and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the thing, for <hi>nomen est symbolum rei,</hi> and this is seen even in these names of day and night, given to light and darknesse; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the name of the day <hi>Jom,</hi> it is very significant and pregnant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and discloseth the nature of the day, and the Hebrew word, which signifieth night, is the negative,
<note place="margin">The day what it signifieth.</note>to the meaning of the day, the day importeth as much as <hi>Ens,</hi> being, shewing us that our being and life, must be imployed altogether in the day time, in some honest exercise and work of our calling, of God or the Country, and that we are not any longer to reckon or accompt our selves, to live or have any being, then when we walke, as in the day, in the course and actions of our life, and work of our calling; for being idle, ill imployed, or sleeping, sloathfully spending and consuming our time in vanity, we<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62585:44"/>are dead and have not the being of men; also there is a good signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation given of those, which take the name of <hi>Jom</hi> from striving and moving, teaching that the day is a time of walking, stirring, speaking and labouring, and the night <hi>e contra,</hi> a time of silence, rest, and ease, and sleep, or rather a time, thereby to restore and recover the strength of body, which in the day was spent by carefull and painfull travell, in which sense I shewed the day to be the work-house, and the night to be our Cabin or Couch of rest, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Lastly, touching this division, we see that the reason of man, is offended with God in this place for naming a day, saying there was a day, so long before there was any Sunne, which seemeth absurde to them, because they think the day dependeth on the Sunne, as on his cause, therein most fasly and grossely, drawing their reason from that which is now, to that which was then at the beginning, in which they argue their ignorance and error, even in learning and Phylosophy.
<note place="margin">Note the Sunne.</note>Wherefore touching this question, whether be the cause of the day, we say and prove according to this, that before there was any Sunne, there was a day, two or three, for the course and order of things are otherwise in the proceeding of nature, then of the first beginning, as we have shewed: Again, touching this particular, we say, that the day is broken and draweth long before we see the Sunne, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the approaching of the light; also when the Sunne is in his Eclipse, and when it is all day long hid and covered with the Clouds, yet we say, &amp; call it, the day time; so the contrary, we see and say, that the day dependeth on the light, not on the Sunne, and his participation of communication. Again, the Sunne is not light, but <hi>vehiculum hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus lucis ex qua fit dies;</hi> and therefore is called the Lamp which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth light, <hi>&amp; tanquam lycbnus,</hi> as <hi>Basill</hi> well faith, which is not light and shining of it self, untill the accessary light be put to it, <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undè,</hi> as this light, by which the day was, afterward was put to the Sunne, and so now since it causeth our day: Again, there are many things, which can and doe conceive and bring forth light, besides the Sunne, as a Flint, Gun-powder, Fire, by which we may perceive a great difference between this light, and the Sunne after, that whether we take the light to be <hi>defluum</hi> or a stream of brightnesse issuing from God for <hi>Nebora</hi> in Hebrew signifieth as well a stream of water, as a beam of light, <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 4. we shall see that light doth not stream from the body of the Sunne only, but from many other things, created as we see, as the fire, <hi>De fluvium ignis fulgor, Ezech.</hi> 1. 4. Also there is <hi>De fluvium firmamenti splendor, Dan.</hi>
12. 3. The streams of
<note n="*" place="margin">Brightnesse.</note> righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse shining from the Firmament,
<note place="margin">Meteors.</note>as streaming and issuing from the impressions and meteors of the Aire; or whether we say, that it streamed from the Heavens, and from Gods glorious Majesty, as light did to the Israelites out of the Pillar, any of these, or altogether, will give them their answer, and repell the frivolous and unlearned objections of the Atheists: or else if we consider as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> doth very wisely think and gather, that is, all things in grosse were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated at the beginning, in the two generalls, Heaven and Earth, though<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62585:44"/>the perfecting and polishing of the Creatures in particular, were by degrees brought to perfection in the six several dayes, so he conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctureth that the Sunne was made when the Heavens were made, at the first, but after the fourth day it was perfected, and had the light annexed to it, this giveth them an answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The use.</note>Now touching the spiritual use of this knowledge, in which we will keep the course of these three things before noted. First, that a distinction of names of us must be truly kept. Secondly, that they might be agreeable to the nature of the things. Thirdly, that we must expresse the nature of things shewed by their names, by our right and well usage and practise of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>I began to teach the last day, that it doth not avail us, that things be distinct in nature, if there be a confusion of names; therefore God in wisdome brought in the right division of both orderly; for though names in affirmation and negation cannot change the true nature of things, <hi>Non amittunt quod sunt cum amissione nominis,</hi> as in <hi>Judaes</hi> name, and though we call Gold Copper, and Lead Silver, yet the false name affirmed or denyed hurteth not the nature; yet notwithstanding, in respect of us, except there be a distinction of certain appellations, names and titles, we shall grow erronious and ignorant of the right natures of things; therefore one setteth down this rule, that <hi>fides nominum est salus proprietatum,</hi> the right keeping of the names truly discerned, is the preserver of the true properties of things: Therefore the Divell, not being able to alter the nature of things made, and distinguished by God, he laboureth in the other to shuffle and confound the names of things, which ought to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, to deceive men: To such God faith,
<hi>Job.</hi> 38. 2. <hi>Who is that which darkneth the Counsell by words without knowledge?</hi> for giving of ill and wrong names, confusedly obscureth the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the natures of things to us, and <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth of it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. he complaineth I say of things in his time <hi>falsly so called.</hi> So may we now complain of

                  </gap>, that is, of the false faith, zeale, sincerity, preaching, and reformation of many, which indeed is but falsly so called; for their unfruitfull faith is no faith, their blinde zeal is no zeal, their reformation is deformation, and their preaching is but a

Wherefore they are in great fault, which give one and the same name both <hi>rei, &amp; privationirei,</hi> to the substance and the shadows of things. This then is the first use, which, by Gods example, we are to learn, namely to term things by their right names, by which God hath distinguished them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, As the names must not be in confusion, so there must be a fitnesse and stablenesse agreeable and correspondent to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the things; for commonly the names and titles of the world are either too bigge or too little in proportion for the nature of things. It men be great in authority and wealth, we are no niggards in our words, but give great and swelling titles to them, though they be of small or no deferts, as <hi>Esay</hi> 32. 5. they will not stick to call
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62585:45"/>
                  <hi>Naball</hi> by the name of <hi>Nalath,</hi> that is, a foolish clownish Chrule, a right worshipfull man, to flatter him withall; but God will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry if we give titles after such a manner, <hi>Job.</hi> 32. 22. As we are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasites to others for favour or gain, so we love to be flattered of others, and to have a great and glorious name for small and simple gifts; though our deeds be very small and few, yet we must bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bast our words as great as may be, but God observeth agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Lastly, We learn that if the name be agreeable to the nature, then in our life and action we must also expresse the nature of the things by well using, as the word teacheth us, that is, that seeing the day is our being, and sheweth that our life and being is laboring and well being in our Calling, therefore we must reckon or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt our selves no longer to live and have the being of a man, then we are in the day imployed in such honest and good actions of life, and esteem our selves in that respect as dead men, or as beasts, when we are idle, slothfull, and given to sleep,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 33, 34. we must be farre therefore from the speech and saying of the sluggard, that is, <hi>yet a little more sleep and slumber,</hi> that is delight in idlenesse. And so must we be far from it in doings, behaviour and custome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 14. which is thus described, <hi>even as a dore moveth on hinges, so doth he in idlenesse,</hi> one calleth such
<hi>fungos &amp; truncos,</hi> shewing that we differ not from blocks, being idle and sleeping, nor from mush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes, eating and drinking, nor from whelps, sporting and playing, but then we are men, when we doe the actions of men, that is, to study for knowledge, and work and travail for thy living, so that the night is our time of <hi>non esse,</hi> so long as we will <hi>ociosum esse.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing Christians <hi>are not of the night but of the day,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 5. we must doe the actions of good works, which belong to the day, and for which the day was made; for idlenesse, theft, adultererie, murther, &amp;c. hate the light, because they are works of darknesse, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. so are there three paire of them set down,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. So the qualities of our actions must be framed to the meaning of the word and nature of the things, which God hath made for us. And this may suffice for the second distribution of the names.</p>

               <p>In the first three things are to be noted: First, Gods Edict: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the execution of it, in the former part of the 7. verse; And the third is the return of the Edict or Writ. <hi>And it was so.</hi> Of the first, in which we consider the word, the manner, and the parts, to whom the Edict is given; and then what, wherein, and to what end it was; namely to distinguish the one waters from the other.</p>
               <p>It pleased God in every daies work, to have severall speech and mention made of his Word and Spirit, the one to exclude necessity, the other to exclude chance or casualty; the word is ever named to conclude and shut out that objection, <hi>quis erat ei consiliarius, Esay</hi> 40. 13, 14. that he had no need of counsell or advise, the other to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>quis dedit illi prior,</hi> for as he did all things without the advise and help of any, by himself, so he did it of his meer goodnesse and grace, without any motive or perswasion of our deserts.</p>
               <p>Touching the word, which I told you was <hi>verbum unum increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; aeternum:</hi> We must consider it abiding in God, as skill, art, and cunning doth abide in a perfect work-man; and his proceedings and manifestation in the Creatures as the skill of an artificer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from him into his work, and there is to be seen: so the second person, the word of God abideth for ever wholly in God, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and resteth in his bosome,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 2. And this, by this means passeth from God the Father, into his workmanship and Creatures, and is to be seen manifestly how wonderfull and glorious Gods word and wisdome and art is, by which he made all: And so may we say of his spirit which is inseparable and coequall with it: for as with our words our breath also proceedeth out of our mouthes, in one action, and at one time: so ever the word and the spirit of God proceedeth from him together, to the perfecting of any work. So we see they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.
2. 3. <hi>Christ by whom God made the World,</hi> is there called <hi>a stamp, or graven form of his Father and the brightnesse of his glory;</hi> so that now here is shewed the second stamp, and impression graven and formed in these works, in which the brightnesse of his Image may be seen, namely his power and wisdome, &amp;c. For by the word of God also were the Heavens made
<hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 6. saith <hi>David,</hi> out of which sentence we may learn two speciall points.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>First, that the word of God is the generall mediator, not only between God and man in the work of redemption, but also between God and his works in this Creation: for after that the word of God was, he by whom all things had their being, and were that they are, and were set joynt and in order by him, then by the same <hi>verbum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatum</hi> proceeding from God, together with that powerfull working of the sanctifying Spirit, were all things new created, and set in right order and joynt again, being by <hi>Adams</hi> sinne clean out of frame.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>The other point is, that whereas it had been all one for <hi>Moses</hi> to say, <hi>Deus dixit aut Deus facit,</hi> he rather causeth this phrase, <hi>Dixit De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>

                  </note>We will begin with the Firmament, which is called <hi>Rachia,</hi> that is <hi>expansio,</hi> a stretching forth abroad; the property of which word includeth the signification of the nature of such actions, whereby metals are driven thin and beaten abroad into plates, as Smiths with their hammers use to doe; in which sense it is taken, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 38. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 9. so the expansion or driving out of metals, is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from whence this word is borrowed, and being so borrowed, it is applied to the spreading or drawing out of any thing what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as of a curtain, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 2.
<note place="margin">The Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven compared.</note>which kinde of phrase by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, is there given to the making of the firmament, as if he had, as it were, spread the Heavens abroad as a curtain; also to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spreading of a vault, to which also the firmament is compared; also to the pulling out abroad and expansion of a roll of paper or parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which also it is likened, <hi>Esay</hi> 34. 4. likewise to the blowing up of glasse out of a lump into a hollow compasse, to which
<hi>Job</hi> resembleth the making of Heaven 37. 18. which comparisons doe yeeld unto us the hidden consideration of this work of God: for such a like work was performed here this second day in making Heaven, as these handy-Crafts men doe shew. Simple comparisons these are to shew such a matter, yet sufficient, sithence we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no better.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In quo.</hi>
                  </note>The two actions of Gods Spirit mentioned before, <hi>sustole &amp; dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stole,</hi> which I said are seen in all works created, are no where better expressed than in this work, for the dilatation and contraction of the spirit moving in this work, was the expansion and stretching out of the Heavens; and the compression and drawing in of his force and virtue is and shall be the dissolution of the firmament, for then they will run and rowle together as a roll, and as molten glasse, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The resemblance and shadow of this work of God we may set before you in a matter of common experience; for it is usuall to see a pot of water, by the force of the fire, to evaporate, and so stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth out of a little pot, as to fill the whole room with his moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture extenuated; and again, being so dilated into a thin vapour, we see it drawn in and compressed into little drops of water again,<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62585:47"/>which also some explane by the manner of distillation, which first riseth as a vapour, filling all, and then resolveth into drops again, and is made the same quantity of water and moisture which it was before. So God in this work, as a Stiller, first, by a vapour rising up by the Sunne, he stretcheth abroad the waters above us, and then the cold congealeth and compresseth that vapour into clouds, and after, by heat, again resolveth and melteth the clouds into drops of rain, which return to the Sea; So that in creating <hi>Coelum aërum,</hi> the rarefying and extenuating the waters into vapors, and so dilating it by expansion, was the first beginning of them. Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is taken after the manner of a thinne stone, or marking stone, with which, faith <hi>Salomon, Prov.</hi> 8.
27. <hi>circuit Coelum quasi cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cino suo,</hi> as if he had a compasse to make a circle for their separation, <hi>Esay</hi> 40. 12. faith, that in this separation with one hand God did hold up the upper waters, and with the other he depressed the waters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: we know it to be a matter of such difficulty, to stop the course of waters, that it busieth the best and wisest heads to stop up the breaches, once being made. Yet God, by his power, doth separate the waters, and keep part above, and his <hi>intergerium,</hi> his partition wall and bank which he useth to divide and keep out one from the other, is the weakest Element, that is, namely the Aire, which is most strange, that that should be <hi>terminus,</hi> a bank and bound to the mighty waters which had most need of a <hi>terminus</hi> to limit it self; yet God hath made of it such a limit which is called <hi>firmamentum,</hi> that is, a most strong, sure, and firm bond, which shall not fail; yea, it is more firm and permanent, than if it had been made of a rock of Adamant, for that the waters would have eaten and perished, but this is most durable, by Gods appointment.</p>

                     <hi>Ad quid.</hi>
                  </note>The last thing is
<hi>ad quid,</hi> namely, that there may be a division. Where generally is implyed a double division, the one is before, of things in nature opposite and contrary, as light and darknesse; the other is here of things which have an inequality, as the purest wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the unclean and impure; for God will have not only evill distinguished from good, but also the things that in degree and quality are better and more excellent, are to be separated from that which is more base and vile; for the not distinguishing these, is the mother of confusion: We must not only mark and beware of the Devill the adversary which is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but also of things which are apparently evil, or are not altogether good: therefore God divided the clearest waters in the best and high place above, and the groslest he set below in the depth. So we have a difference between <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> pendiculam, &amp; aquam fluidam,</hi> the one is <hi>Mare superum,</hi> the other is <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re inferum.</hi> This is the division of the Waters.</p>
               <p>Now in the upper waters of <hi>Coelum aëreum,</hi> there are two parts, <hi>aqua <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp; aura flabilis,</hi> which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> together. Now between these two waters thus divided, because they are not contrary in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only different in degree, the inferior and baser waters doe first, as it were, reverently acknowledge their humility, by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62585:48"/>sending up vapours to them in the Clouds; and they, as gratefull, doe send down drops and showers more liberally, even powring them down again: So there is a mutuall reciprocation and circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in nature between them, as ebbing and flowing is below; so is there breathing up and dropping down between them both.</p>
               <p>But to what end are these waters above and below, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is there a division of them? Because God had before taken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for light, that there might be time, it was next of all convenient and meet that he should take order for place, wherein his Creatures might inhabite; for in that place where the thick and compact body of the waters is, the Creature could have but a slow motion; and therefore it is no fit Element for us: Wherefore God having an eye to man, respecting him in all his works, provided in this, that he might have a fit Element of Aire, in which he might live, move, and have his being.</p>
               <p>The end of the other division and separation was this, that the waters being thus set apart, might be as a bridge for us, not only from one Country to another, by ship here on the nether waters, but also that there might be a communication and passage from Earth to Heaven, by the means of the Aire; for the Aire is, as it were, the bridge and path and casement, by which the light of Heaven commeth to us; it is the pipe, through which sounds and voyces come to our cares, smells to our nostrils, colors to our eyes; it is the strainer or five, through which, as <hi>Job</hi> faith, the rain is sifted in little drops, but especially as you know in the first day God made light, which hath a proportion and resemblance to this word <hi>John</hi> 8. 12. yea, it is
<hi>vox Creatorum</hi> also; for the dumb and senslesse things doe, as it were, speak and tell us what they are by the light; So, if you mark, the Aire, which is made the second day, hath a resemblance to Gods Spirit; for as the Aire is the act of breathing, which we easily fashion and receive into our bodies; so our spiritual life is by the holy Ghost, of whom we have the like apprehension, and as light commeth to our eyes by the Aire, and words to our ears, so that by it we apprehend light and speech and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so is the Spirit of God the very means whereby our souls doe apprehend the spiritual light, and by which the word of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the ears of our hearts; So spiritually the Holy Ghost is <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiculum lucis, &amp; vocis Dei,</hi> &amp;c. and this we learn by way of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</p>
               <p>The last point is concerning this, to know to what end are these upper waters of the Aire. We are to know, that God made them to be his
<hi>magnus Thesaurus,</hi> his great treasure house for store, <hi>Deut.</hi>
28. 3. for there he saith he will at his pleasure open this great store house, and out of it give the first and latter rain and snow, to moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and make fruitfull the Earth, which is so great a blessing that we are bound to praise God continually for his gracious work.</p>

In the work we observed three points, according to the three severall verbs <hi>Dixit, fecit &amp; sit:</hi> The first containeth the precept or warrant for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the work. The second the workmanship and going about to doe or make it. The third, the return and certificate to signifie that it was fully executed, which three are in <hi>Dixit, fecit &amp; factum est.</hi>

<hi>Heb.</hi> 12 2. so that we shall confesse, as here, that <hi>quod fecit factum est.</hi> So that that is the first consideration in God, that these three severall things, saying, doing, and perfecting, are inseparable in him, joyned and linked together as a chain, that one ensuing the other and all following the first.</p>
               <p>The first of these hath been shewed before; the two last, the Work and the Certificate are now to be handled in order. The Work, in this seventh verse, touching which, we see that it doth stand on two points and parts. First, He made it. Secondly, He separated it.</p>
               <p>Concerning the making, the word <hi>gnasha</hi> signifieth to make, which hath an opposite and divers sense, from two words which may seem to be the same too, meaning <hi>Esay</hi> 45. 7. there is these three words

To make presupposeth a matter subject; but to create, is to make of nothing, in the first day God created of nothing; but now in this work he is a maker, for <hi>Coelum aëreum</hi> was made of something, the<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62585:49"/>Heavens were planted,

                  </note>For <hi>Time us</hi> the Pythagorean, and <hi>Plato,</hi> that great Philosopher, holding the truth of the Creation, doe notwithstanding advise this rooted thorne, that they suppose God only but to give out the Edict and direction how and what should be done, and to make certain <hi>Demones &amp; Intelligentiae</hi> to be the workers, doers, and bringers to passe of the work; and so, in that respect, ascribing worship and honour to them, as the Instruments and Agents in this action. But God is here set down, not only as the Master Builder, to oversee and give direction; but also he was the only Agent and Workman which did make it himself, he both gave out the Edict with his word, and with the same did fulfill and bring it to passe: So that there was but one Commander, who, the self same, was the Maker also, <hi>Esay</hi>

<hi>Salomon</hi> gave the form, so God gave the matter of the world and the Angels the form and fashioning of it: But God in this work is alone, for his work standeth not as ours doth, that is, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the form of the work should come from divers Authors, as before we can come to Iron plate, we must fetch the matter from the Ironmonger and the form from the Smith; before we can have a Garment, we must have the matter from the Draper and the form from the Taylor: But with God it is not so, for from him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth both the matter and form of all Creatures, <hi>creat, facit, format.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the first resolution of this question, to which there is a second answer, which is good for instruction,
<note place="margin">

                  </note>taken out of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the word <hi>gnasha;</hi> for the Hebrews use it in their phrase, not only to make a thing, but also to trim up and to give a better form to any thing; in which sense it is said, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 24. that <hi>Mephiboseth had not made his beard nor his feet,</hi> by which is meant, had not trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his beard nor washed his feet, which he had made to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62585:50"/>So God in this place is said, by this <hi>gnasha,</hi> to give the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form to these Heavens, and so to trim and perfect them up as they should be; for they being made before in gross, now he stretched them out after a circular form, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 8. as having made a Curtain, should spread it abroad, and set it up, whereas before it lay wrapt up rudely together, <hi>Job.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>tendit Coelum,</hi> that is, now he did bend and bow the Heavens compassed as a bow, which was made before, but not half round, but circular round, and sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall; and not only did he set this form to them, but also gave them a circular &amp; sphericall motion to turn round in their course about the Earth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 6. it doth goe in his compasse, <hi>in gyra sue, Preach.</hi> 1. 5, 6. the Sunne and Windes doe goe a circuit, <hi>in circuttione, vel cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitu suo.</hi> Thirdly, He in this kinde of making them did now add to them a virtue, force, and heavenly influence,
<hi>Job</hi> 38. 31. which heavenly and comfortable influence is called the sweetnesse of the Heavens, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 13. Therefore we are willed to praise God <hi>in firmamento virtutis suae, Psal.</hi> 150. 2. by which virtue the Heavens have a comfortable and reviving force, an action, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and dominion, as the word sign fieth, in these Creatures below.</p>
               <p>And thus much of <hi>fecit.</hi> Now of the things which he made. First, We see that whereas the Heavens before were compact and entire. Now by Gods workmanship they are scattered and spread round about and divided; for being made, it was Gods purpose, that it should be to this use, to be parted asunder into two parts.</p>
               <p>The Heavens by some is called <hi>tenue expansum,</hi> that is, a thing thinly spread abroad. In the making of it we consider the Maker and the manner of it, which is both simply and plainly, and also comparatively by way of resemblance set down in the Scriptures;
<note place="margin">The Spirit of God.</note>for the power &amp; force by which it was made, was the Spirit of God,

14, 15. <hi>If he draw or gather in his Spirit, they perish again:</hi> So that all that is made, is ascribed to the expansion and motion of the Spirit going out; and the undoing or marring any thing is attributed to the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of it again.</p>

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:62585:51"/>Now for the comparison, this work of the Spirit is compared to an Eagle, or any other bird, in sitting on the egges to hatch their young: For so God having made a nest and layed or brought forth his young, as it were, unperfected, doth now by his spirit <hi>incubare,</hi> that is sit and spread his wings over them, and so giving vitall life and power, break the shell, <hi>&amp; sic pullulavit mundum.</hi> Thus we see the power of Gods Spirit in the nature of the Word, and the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the comparison here used.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The end why God made the Heavens.</note>Now the end why he made them was, That it might be a Pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion or Tent,

               <p>We see here God divideth the Clouds from the Channels, which upper Waters he divideth into several chambers or stories called
<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignationes, Psal.</hi> 104. 3. which we call the three Regions of the Aire, in the uppermost of which is <hi>snow</hi> and <hi>hail,</hi> in the middle one <hi>rain,</hi> in the lower <hi>dews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another division is this, God made not the upper waters entirely on compact substance, but bound them up in divers bonds of clouds, that through them, being divided, the light and influence of Heaven might passe down to the earth through them, which else could not. There are three things of which we read in the Scripture, which are raised out of the Earth, and doe concurre and meet in the Aire, of which, two have names, and by them we may give a name to the third; the first is the <hi>Clouds,</hi> which are called his
<hi>Chariots,</hi> and the second are the <hi>Windes,</hi> or horses that draw them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 2. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the third, which is the

               <p>Now for the congealed waters by the cold: <hi>God giveth the snow like wooll,</hi> to keep out the cold blasts of the North winde, that the seed may be warm and nourished in the ground, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 16. <hi>and he scattereth the frest to serve for ashes,</hi> to keep in the seed which is in the Earth, that it spire not, nor spread out too soon, before it be well sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned and rooted in the Earth, lest after it should for want of root and deepnesse of Earth dry and wither away when the Sunne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <hi>Luk.</hi>
8. 6. Thus we see the waters elevated and drawn up loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in clouds and thrown down to our great use and benefit.

               <p>Now of both these together was the Firmament made: For this Aire, <hi>Coelum aëreum,</hi> is more necessarie for men then the light which was made the first day; for we may have a use of darknesse, and sleep without light, but we cannot live, sleeping nor waking, without Aire

               <p>Here are two things in this to be considered, first <hi>virtus verbi:</hi> Secondly, <hi>obedientia Creaturae.</hi> The power of Gods word is seen in that it is able to bring to passe any thing <hi>sine mora, sine labore: Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> would build a Temple very beautifull, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 6. 38. but he could not doe it in lesse time then seven years; and after, when it was made the second time, fourty and six years they say the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was making, and can Christ reare it up presently in three dayes? this they thought impossible, but behold here is a greater Temple then <hi>Salomons</hi> was, yet he made the whole frame of it in no longer space and time then one may say <hi>fiat Coelum,</hi> for presently <hi>fuit sic,</hi> saith <hi>Moses, Psal.</hi> 148.

                     <hi>Obedientia Creaturae.</hi>
                  </note>Touching the obedience of the Firmament created, we have three things to consider: First, with what celerity, conformity, and constancie all things were done as God would have them. For the speed and celerity: We see that the Waters, as if they had ears to hear what the word commanded, &amp; wings to flie about the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it so soon, yea more speedily they did it. We read in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that God preached to none but only to man; for it is enough for him only to say the word to all Creatures of the Earth else, and it is done; but he must stand and take pains to preach an hour every day to perswade us that are men, which are farre more beholden unto God than any Creature else, and yet it will<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62585:53"/>not avail to make us obedient to his word.</p>
               <p>As for conformity to his word, it was <hi>sic,</hi> even after the manner and form in all respects as he would have it: But if we doe a thing it is lame and unperfect in some respect, and not conformable to his will.</p>
               <p>Last of all constancie and perpetuity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 91.
<hi>they continue still according to their ordinance; for all things serve thee: He hath set thee a Law which shall not be broken, Psal.</hi> 148. 6. For it is a wonder that such Seas of waters which hang and fly over our heads daily, doe not fall on us, and with their weight destroy us; for we see what a bucker of water is for heavinesse in his fall, yet the pillers of God uphold them that they fall not, which pillers one would think should be <hi>aere,</hi> that is, made of brasse, but they are <hi>aëreae,</hi> airie pillers, and yet last longer and are more durable then the greatest brasen pillers that we can imagine, for in time they would corrupt and be eaten up of the waters; but yet the power of God hath so strengthned the Aire, that being the weakest thing that is, as our Proverb saith, <hi>As weak as Water,</hi> not being able to sustain it self, no not to be a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to hold up a feather from the ground, yet it is made a Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, a most firm, sure, and durable piller to uphold all these Clouds and bottels of water above; they move <hi>motu immobili &amp; varietate invariabili,</hi> and so <hi>they continue after Gods ordinance, even unto this day,</hi> as the Psalmist saith.</p>

               <p>WHich words contain in them the second principall part of the second dayes work, which is the word of denomination and entitling the Firmament thus with a new name.

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to give it a name agreeable thereunto.</p>
               <p>Touching the denomination in general, I shewed four things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which I will not repeat now, but only, call to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. The first was, The name of things are of freehold, and therefore must move us to attention, because, though these works are beneficiall to all Creatures, yet the apprehension of their names belong only to man, at whom God did aime and levell in this work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:62585:53"/>The second, That the things which are divers in nature, must be distinguished in name.</p>
               <p>The third, The manner of giving names must be in proportion agreeable to the nature of them.</p>
               <p>And lastly, What the significations of the names are. Not repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this generality, we will now descend to the particularity of this name, and see by the notations of the word what is signified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>The old English called the Heavens <hi>aloft,</hi> as though it were lifted up, as it was out of the deep. The Latines call it <hi>Caelum quasi caelatum,</hi> that is, <hi>embroidered and garnished,</hi> as it is. The Grecians call it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>quasi terminus mundi,</hi> as it were the border and bound of the World. The Hebrews call it <hi>Shameshe:</hi> Concerning which word there is three several opinions, all which may be well and to good purpose received: There are of the Hebrews which deduce the word from the verb <hi>Shama,</hi> which is to wonder, because of the admiration which all men have of this glorious World, especially if we consider with <hi>David, Psal</hi> 8. 4, 5. that God having such excellent and glorious Creatures in Heaven should so, notwithstanding, regard man, which is but a clod of earth, as to endue him with these divine graces, and with a reasonable soul: The admirablenesse of this work consisteth first, In that they being made of the dreggs of the deep, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the most splendent and glorious Creatures of God. Also in that they moving continually are <hi>immobilia,</hi> and varying and changing in their courles alwaies, are notwithstanding <hi>invariabilia,</hi> for they move <hi>motu immobili &amp; varietate invariabili.</hi> Also in that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of water, which is most weak and infirm, are nothwithstanding most sure and firm of all other things. The other opinion taketh it from the verb <hi>Magam</hi> and the adverb <hi>Iham,</hi> as if God had appointed with his finger to the Heavens and said, Here are all things, if you want light, waters, either for soul or bodie, here they are to be found, and here you may have it, as indeed
<hi>all good graces come from above, from our Father in Heaven, Jam.</hi> 1.
17.</p>
               <p>The second note touching the word is, in that it is of the duall number, which implyeth that the Heavens are double and two fold, which is apparent in the 17. verse, where it is said, that <hi>the Starres are in Heaven,</hi> and in the 26. verse it is said, <hi>that the Fowls also flye in Heaven.</hi> Now this is plain and sensible in every mans eyes, that the starres are not where the Birds doe flie, neither doe the Fowles flie where the Starres are. Out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 33. the ancient Hebrews doe note to us, that there was a former and later Heaven, a higher and a lower Heaven made by God, the lower Heavens in the Scriptures are usually termed and called
<hi>Coeli, Psal.</hi> 148. 4. and the upper Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which is the Seat of God, is called <hi>Coeli Coelorum,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8. 27. and in other places, for as there was in the Temple of <hi>Salemon San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum &amp; Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> so in the the great Temple of the world there is <hi>Coelum &amp; Coelum Coelorum,</hi> to answer to it in the upper and higher Heavens, as was shadowed in the Temple, is the mercy Seat,<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62585:54"/>the Altar, and the Propiciatory; but in the nether is <hi>atrium, I. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, &amp;c,</hi> that is, a division of severall Courts for Starres, Clouds, Fowls, Men, &amp;c. Between the higher and the nether Heavens, as it was in the Temple, there is a Vail or Curtain spread, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19. which doth part the one from the other. Besides these two Heavens we read of a third Heaven, 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. which is the highest number we read of in Gods word, so that besides the Merchant mans Heavens, which is prosperous winde, and besides the Husbandmans Heaven, from whence commeth seasonable weather in Summer and Winter; there is a third Heaven which we must seek for, which is <hi>Regnum Coelorum,</hi> for the Fowles doe flie <hi>per medium Coelorum,</hi> 17. and
26. verses, as the Angell did, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 13. therefore there is a Heaven on both sides of this middle Heaven. The impressions of the Aire are the Host and Army of the nether Heavens, and the Starres are the Hostes of God, which inhabite and are in Garrison in the second Heavens, and the Hosts of Heavenly Souldiers, Saints, and Angells, are the Armies of the third Heavens,
<hi>Luke</hi> 2. 13. which Heaven is called <hi>solum gloriae,</hi> for Heaven is his throne, it is called <hi>the habitation of Gods holinesse, Esay</hi> 63.
15. And God is described by this place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 34. <hi>Deus qui sedet in Coelum, Psal.</hi> 121. 2. so his place is in the third and highest Heavens, and from thence cometh the true winde and spirit, <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. and the true rain and dew and water of Grace and life, <hi>John</hi> 4 14. and from thence discended the true bread of life, <hi>John</hi> 6. 32. and the oyle of joy and all good things spirituall whatsoever; and from thence we are to look for them; Thus we may consider of Heaven, though we might here rather know and learn the way thither, then curiously to search what it is, which we cannot finde nor comprehend, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
               <p>I come to the two other Heavens, because this place teacheth and warranteth us only but of these two. Touching the second Heaven, this we finde, that it is a glorious body, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 10. though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of and by the waters, as <hi>St. Peter</hi> saith 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. as in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we see no diversity or variety; yet in the bodie of the Heavens there is great variety; for it is as it is in natural things. In a kernel we can perceive no variety, but yet it bringeth a tree forth, which hath great variety, as a body of wood, bark, leaves, blossoms, and fruit, and by this incarnation we have participation of those graces, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 20. and he calleth all to him to buy these waters, <hi>John</hi> 7. 38. 39. and by his spirit he will power them into our souls, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5.

17. 18. by our waters we can passe from one Country to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Waters of Grace.</note>These waters of Grace are contained in the clouds of the Law, the preaching thereof doth drop gratious words, as the dew, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 2. and therefore the wiseman saith, that <hi>the lipps of instruction are a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of life;</hi> so the preaching and ministery of Gods word is the clouds and bottels which hold this water.

26. 12.</p>
               <p>Now as God, in the name of Heaven, holdeth up the finger, as it were, and saith here is waters to be had and looked for, so the same word of God which made the Heavens, must give these waters from thence; and therefore
<hi>they which want wisdome, and knowledge, let them ask and seek them of God, Jam.</hi> 1. 5. 17.

               <p>THE action of the second day was suspended, as I told you the last time, and in some sort left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done and unperfect, by reason that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet delayed and deferred the approbation of the Heavens, untill he should shew us what should become of the nether waters then sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; wherefore having declared how the upper waters, being lift up, were stretched and spread abroad, and made a Firmament; now he sheweth how the nether waters below were gathered together to make the Seas, and withall he sheweth us the Earth (which, as <hi>St. Ambrose</hi> saith, lay as a wrack in the middest and bottom of the waters) was by Gods word drawn up and brought to light, and made profitable for man and beast. For after the swadling bands of darknesse were removed and the disordered course of waters, well ordered and disposed, then<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62585:55"/>the eye of Gods providence, from which nothing is hid, beholdeth the Earth which was covered and swallowed up in the deep, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 6. and so he delivereth it of his goodnesse both from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward impediments of the waters, which kept it from the sight of the light, and also from the inward and naturall inconvenience of emptinesse, by which it was unmect for any living thing to dwell on it; which mercy of God, because it sheweth it self to Earth, &amp; we are earth, dust and ashes, therefore it doth so much the more neerly teach and concern us, though light was made, and the firmament framed, yet both these parts of the world, and the world it self was unperfect, untill the Earth was discovered. Therefore <hi>Moses</hi> telleth us, that God did, as it were, make haste and speedily passe over the first and second day, that he might the sooner come to the Earth, which in the next place he frameth, partly to shew that he is not bound to any course or frame in building his house, as to descend orderly from the cealing of Heaven down to the foundation of the Earth, and partly to manifest his spirituall care and providence that he hath for the Earth and earthly things, indeed, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet telleth us, <hi>Esay</hi> 45.
18. <hi>God made not the Earth in vain, but to this end, that it might be habitable,</hi> but it passeth our capacities to think that God would put it to so honourable a use, as to be the place on which he would set his chief delight; But whereas we would think that God, being in Heaven, would not abase himself to vouchsafe to look down on the Earth in this miserable and desolate case; yet now this third day being come, in which the Earth should be made and perfected, we see God adorneth this work with a double Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, with two actions, and a double approbation, to shew his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care and delight he had in this work, for here is twice <hi>dixit Deus,</hi> and twice
<hi>fecit,</hi> and twice <hi>dixit Deus bonum esse,</hi> which repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of redoubling we only see when there is another revolution and another third day, in which God made man of the Earth, to be the perfection of the Earth, as it was the perfection of the world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we see, that though the Heavens were his own habitation, and the Earth he meant to give and bestow on men,

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4 Parts.</note>In this dayes work we are to consider four parts, each doubled, First, two Decrees; then two Actions performed: Thirdly, by two accomplishments: Fourthly, by two approbations.</p>
               <p>On the Earth we see two actions necessarily performed, First, the emptying and removing of that it should not have, which was the outward impediment of a huge number of waters, which hindred the sight of it and ability to be inhabited.</p>
               <p>The second the delivering and removing from it his nether and inward inconvenience of emptinesse, being void of all things meet for habitation, and replenishing it with store and variety of Plants and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62585:56"/>Herbs, &amp;c. And so having removed the outward and inward impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, <hi>Tohu, Tobohu,</hi> which it had within and without, he finished the work of God, getteth out a severall warrant to remove both inconveniences, to this end, that it be habitable and stored with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries for them that dwell therein.</p>
               <p>The parts are the Decree and the Action; the giving out of the Decree is to be considered in this word <hi>Dixit,</hi> the tenor of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is durable: First, for the removing of the waters: Secondly, for the appearing of the Earth: The third and last place setteth down the accomplishment of it. Touching the giving out of the Decree, to omit the things before rehearsed, I will deliver these three points, First, the giving out of it in regard of God: Secondly, touching the word: Thirdly, of the number.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>For the first, Seeing
<hi>Abraham</hi> maketh it a great matter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 27. that Earth should seem to speak to God, we may think it a wonder and a strange thing that God should so abase himself, as it were, to behold, much more to vouchsafe to speak to this rude and poor Creature, which lay in worse and baser case than any other; for whereas other Creatures in their imperfection had but one incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, we see this had two, without and within: Wherefore, if we make this a matter of inquiry, the Scriptures shew us this reason, that it is Gods usuall custome and nature and delight, to shew his goodnesse, especially in exalting things humble and most base, and <hi>to lift the poor out of the mire, Job</hi> 5. 11. It is a known thing, that God <hi>Humilibus dat gratiam, Pro.</hi> 3. 34. which all the Apostles also teach; wherefore the Earth, being the lowest and basest, and most poor and humble, doth God of his grace and goodnesse choose to give it this grace, and to exalt it thus.</p>
               <p>The Prophet telleth us, that God had made choise to dwell in two places, <hi>Habitat aut in aeternitate,</hi> or else <hi>habitat in humilitate,</hi> that is, he will no where dwell, but either in the high Heavens, or else in the low and humble Earth. Therefore of his goodnesse he vouchsafed to seek a treasure house in the Earth wherein to keep his chosen, and so hath made the Earth, as it were, the ornament of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</p>
               <p>Thus we see the Decree in respect of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly for the Word. As we saw the word of God to be the piller of the Heavens, so here we see it serveth to build and uphold the Earth, and as the Spirit then moving, by dilatation made and spead abroad the Heavens, so here the work and power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is seen in contraction, for so the Earth was made, and the Seas, gathering in the waters; and as the Heavens were by division, so now the Earth and Waters are made by union, being joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that as a mans hand is called
<hi>instrumentum instrumentorum;</hi> So Gods word is Gods hand, <hi>by which the Heavens and Earth were made, Psal.</hi> 33. 6. <hi>By the word of the Lord the Heavens were made,</hi> that is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. 25. <hi>they are the work of his hands,</hi> the Word and Spirit, and as there he speaketh of them as of a body, so here he calleth it <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goga</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:62585:56"/>
                  <hi>aquarum,</hi> a concourse or gathering of waters, thereby comparing the Sea to a great Cathedrall Church, and the Arms, Streams, and Rivers to be as it were Parish Churches to that Sea or Diocesse; so that as all inferiour Parishes are ordered and depend on their Mother Church, so doth this teach us to think of the Seas and gathering of waters.</p>
               <p>Touching the name and title given to them, there are divers judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and opinions, but they may be reduced to these four:
<note place="margin">1.</note>The first hath a denotation and pointing at the properties and qualities of the water and Seas:
<note place="margin">1.</note>And first from the plenty and aboundance of them, in which sense we call any great quantity a Sea, as a Sea of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of troubles, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, For the instability, in which respect, the wicked are compared to the Sea, as tossed in trouble and wavering in inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>Esay</hi> 57. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, In respect of the raging and unrulinesse of the Seas, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 7.
<note place="margin">2.</note>therefore, for these ill qualities of the waters, they think that God gave the Sea this name: Other think that God gave not that name to signifie any evill, but rather the good properties and nature of it, and therefore they say that it hath its name because the Seas were, as it were, the mother, out of whose wombe the earth was taken, as
<hi>Eve</hi> out of <hi>Adams</hi> side, and it was not only taken <hi>e visceribus aquarum,</hi> as having a wombe, as <hi>Job</hi> saith 38. 8. but also the Earth taketh his nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment <hi>ex visceribus aquarum,</hi> for of it self it is dry &amp; witherly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 16. and is as a Child thirsting, gaping, and opening his mouth for the moisture of the waters to drink and be satisfied with it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. 6. so they think that it hath his name hereof, and from and out of it issueth the Earth, and is nourished also thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>The third sort think that it is nominated from the scituation and place which it hath, for if we look in a Map of the World and set our face to the East, we shall see that the Seas are placed on the right hand and the Earth scituated on the left, as giving it the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>The fourth and last sort are the best, who considering the two words which signifie the Earth and the Sea,
<hi>Majim &amp; Jamin,</hi> for the first letter put to the latter end of the other word maketh them all one, and the last letter of the second word put before the first, maketh the two words to be all one without difference, which is done only by a transposition of letters, which shew that Waters naturally are above the Earth, and yet by Gods transposition the Earth is set above the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and so they are without difference joyned as in one Globe.</p>
               <p>This transposition of the things they gather out of the transposition of words; for at the first naturally the Seas eat up and devoure the Earth, but now being transposed and set aloft, it feedeth and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; at the first it was the grave of the Earth, but now it is as a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 6. and so by Gods spirit it is transposed, and God did as it were change and transpose his Decree to have it so, <hi>Job</hi> 38.
10.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:62585:57"/>The third point is, That it is set down in the plurall number; for though we call all the gathering together of the waters but one body, singular, yet it hath two shores, which are the Seas lips through which he thrusteth forth, as it were, his tongue by rivers into the land, so in his parts it is plurall, as in arms and fingers, but all this plurality joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth together in one salt Sea, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 3. and we doe call that the main Ocean Sea, which is the greatest place whereto is the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all waters, <hi>Joshuah</hi> 15.7. and 47. <hi>Job</hi> calleth the Seas, the bottom of waters 38. 16. and the other Rivers and streams to be, as it were, salt tears dropping and distilling from the eyes of the deep Seas, which running through the veins of the Earth is cleansed and purified from his brackish and barren nature, and so it is made profitable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and good.</p>
               <p>Now to the second part of this work, which is Gods approbation, touching which, first of Gods view, and then of the goodnesse of them.</p>
               <p>This speech is taken from Artificers; for as they having made a thing, will return to behold and view it, either to amend it if it be amisse, or to commend it if be well. So it is said, That God, having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected all waters above and below and the Earth, he took a view and consideration of them, not to amend or correct them, for he needed not, because he is so perfect a workman that all his works are most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and cannot be amended or made better; for though foolish men think this or that evill, or imagine how it may be better, yet God knoweth all to be most absolutely and perfectly good; and therefore it is said that his looking on it was only to approve and allow it as good in it self for us, and herein God differeth from men; for men are carelesse in their work, so they doe it, they care not how it be done; but God will not doe a thing, but he will see it well done, and confirm and avouch it to be perfectly good.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Duplex usus.</hi>
                  </note>This example teacheth us to have a double use of Gods Creatures: The one a naturall use of them, as the Earth to tread on, the light to see by: The other is a spirituall use, which is <hi>usus reflexus,</hi> which is the consideration of Gods mercie and goodnesse in making these things, and our gratefull acknowledgement thereof, for as God would not make them materially, but regard and consider them in their qualities spiritually; so we in using them naturally, must make this spirituall use of them <hi>admirari Artem, adorare Artificem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will first speak of the Waters, and then of the goodnesse of them:
<note place="margin">Of the nether Waters.</note>We have before spoken of the upper waters; now this is to be understood of these below, which are gathered together in the Seas; for these also God saith are good, in speaking of which, we must divide the waters, as the old Hebrews, for all waters are good, both those which they call the waters of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> that is, good and sweet waters, for which <hi>David</hi> longed, 1
<hi>Reg.</hi> 23. 15. and also the waters of <hi>Jericho,</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi>
2. 19. which were salt and unfruitfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Waters of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> and
<hi>Jericho.</hi>
                  </note>Touching the waters of <hi>Bethlem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>First, they were good; for they have a double use, profit, and goodnesse which we finde; the one is by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62585:57"/>reason of a filthinesse and foul soil and corruption which the Earth and Earthly things bring to us, and which our own sweat and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will cause about us, and it is a necessarie virtue to wash, cleanse, and purifie or scourc those things about us which are foul and unclean, as by pouring water into our hands to wash them, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 5.
10. 14. or to wash our cloaths and apparrel, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 24. if we should want and lack water but for these uses, it would be ill with us, so good and necessary they are for our life. This good and necessary use of water is spiritually signified in the Lavor of the Temple in the old Law, and in the Sacrament of Baptism in the new Testament.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>The second goodnesse and benefit in it, is in regard of drought and heat; for when we or the Earth is dry and thirsty, the water is drink with his moisture to satisfie it, and when we are hot, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, naturally cold, hath a cooling face to refresh us, as the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a chafe and set in a heat by chafing is faint, and longeth and brayeth for the waters, <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 1. so doth mans heart thirst and cannot endure the drought and heat within, except it be cooled with the drink of the waters; and therefore it is said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 10.
<hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquavit Deus,</hi> that is (as the word importeth) when God made the waters, he began, and did, as it were, drink to all the Creatures, shewing them that there was the place where they should fetch drink, and so to pledge him for ever thereat: And in respect of this goodnesse which we finde in the nature of the waters, we see that those things which are very good, and so necessary that we cannot be without them, they are compared and said to be <hi>as cold as water to a faint and thirsty soul, Prov.</hi> 25. 25. Besides this, it hath a good use to dresse our meats as well as to be drinke.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Salt Waters.</note>Now for the waters of
<hi>Jericho.</hi> Those are bitter and brackish wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Seas, they were made also very good, and to a most commodious use, for they are made
<hi>promptuarius,</hi> a store house or treasury from whence cometh all waters in the world, both above in the Clouds and below in the Earth:
<note place="margin">Clouds, Waters from the Sea.</note>For the Clouds, it is said; that <hi>God calleth and raiseth waters out of the Sea, and causeth it to ascend into the Clouds, and so by drops to descend down into the Earth; Amos</hi> 5. 8. So the Cloud waters are from the Seas.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">So fresh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note>So are all the fresh waters in the fountains and springs, for as <hi>Job</hi> saith 38. 8. they are
<hi>tanquam lachrymae</hi> trickling and distilling from the eyes and head of the Seas; for they make the world as a body like a man, as they compare man to the World; for the head and higher parts is the waters, the bones of the bodie is the Quarries and Rocks, the Muscles and Flesh is the earthly part of hills, &amp;c. the Conduit pipes and Fountains of Water streaming and running in the Earth, are called the veins of the Earth; that the Springs and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains issuing and springing out; are as the blood letting and opening of a vein; and as in a mans body when the veins are

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, the whole body must needs he overwhelmed and all imbrued in his own blood, and perish; so it is said of the World,<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62585:58"/>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 11. in the great deluge, in which the World perished by water, <hi>rupti sunt fontes Abyssi,</hi> which breaking up of the fountains was the cause that the waters played above the Earth, so that all the blood and veins come and goe to one head and originall of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; so the Rivers have their waters from the Sea, and doe return them thither again, <hi>Preach.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
               <p>And this is the third miracle which we see in this work of the Waters: First, We saw them at Gods word ascending up into the Clouds, and descending. Secondly, The lower waters standing up on a heap and continuing so. Thirdly, That the Rivers ever running into the Sea, and yet are never empty and dry: and again the Sea ever receiving all waters that come, and thereby being ever full, is not satisfied as never full, and yet never overmatcheth the bancks, which wonderfull miracle in this work of God we see every day, and yet regard it not.</p>
               <p>

But though we can have our horses and Wagons on the Land when we list, yet cannot Mariners and Merchants have their Sea Wagoners to drive their Wagons there, at their pleasures, but must wait and tarry Gods leisure for prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous gales; and merry windes are sent them at the good pleasure and commandement of God, and by reason of this goodnesse and benefit of waters God hath caused it, that the Harvest of the Seas, and the Treasure of the Sands shall be as great and greater then the Harvest of the Land, and that the wealth of Merchants shall goe beyond the wealth and treasure of the Husbandmen, <hi>Esay</hi> 23. 3. yea we see that

<note place="margin">An excellent benefit of the Sea.</note>but that which is most, we should have been ever without the knowledge of Gods holy
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62585:58"/>Word; For how could that have come hither, Or how could we have gone beyond the Seas for it, had it not been for the Sea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in goe the Ships? <hi>Pauls</hi> Shipwrack was most blessed and happy to that Island,
<hi>Act.</hi> 27. 41. for by that means the Gospell of Christ came to them, the greatest commodity that could be; But unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy are we of this Pearl which Merchants have sound and brought from beyond the Sea, seeing we so lightly regard, that we will scarce step out of doores for to hear it, this is the good that we by it have Merchants, <hi>Nahum.</hi> 3. 16. Another benefit of good we receive by them, <hi>Nahum.</hi> 3. 14. in that they are made to us as a Ditch, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, Wall, or Bulwark of strength and defence to the Land. For in Islands we are intrenched, as it were, round about, with Sands, with Rocks, with Ships, and Seas. These things more properly pertain to us Islanders; for Islands are called the branches of the Sea.</p>
               <p>For main Lands have other carriage and defence, though with more trouble and cost. Lastly, It is good for <hi>Peter</hi> with his Nets and Gins to take Fish.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The discourse of the Earth.</note>Now for the Earth, God also saw and said that <hi>it was good</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, which is so well known, that I need not tell you that the use of it a top is not only good to goe and runne upon, and inhabite, but also to bear Corn, Wine, Oyle, Herbs, and Roots, and other Fruit, for Man and Beast, that dwell thereon <hi>Job.</hi>
28. 5. And under the good mould for fruit, we see it good and profitable, in that it hath mines of Coale, and under it veins of Gold, and other most profitable metals, and under it precious stones, and every where within Quarries and Rocks of stone, and without Trees of timber to build us houses withall. This were sufficient to make us see and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, to Gods glory, how good it is to us.</p>
               <p>But let us come to the very substance of the Earth, in respect of the whole, and (not to search his riches and parts and fruits) we see that it is the matter of which we are made, and to which we must return,

               <p>Now as we have considered the goodnesse of it wholly; so now let us see the parts by themselves, <hi>the hills, mountains, and rocks are good for shaddows in time of heat, and for shelter in time of Winter against cold and tempests, Esay</hi> 32. 2. <hi>the stoney rocks also serve for Conies, Psal.</hi> 104. 18. <hi>the valleys and dales are good and commodious for Corn, Psal.</hi> 104. 10. <hi>Esay</hi> 30. 23. <hi>and also for pasture, Psal.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The Waters and Land joyntly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, four things noted therein.</note>Yet let us further consider these things, that is, the Waters and Land joynt together, as they are framed in one globe, touching which we have four things to note.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>The first, is in regard of Heaven and Celestiall bodies, where we shall observe a threefold good; for a thing that is good only in it self, and doth not impart it to other, is good in vain, and to no end; and that which is good to it self, and hath a nature to be good to other, but hath noe good means to conceive it, is to no purpose: Wherefore, as the Heavens have vertue and goodnesse, as light, heat, dews, &amp;c. So the Aire is the good means by which it is sent and conveyed, and the Earth is that receptacle which receives all those good things imparted to it: So all the good of Heaven is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the Earth by the Aire, and so it is made known and proved to be good. The Earth is the pond of all waters, and the lap and open hand, yea, and the wide open mouth which God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive all the blessings of Heaven, untill Heaven have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, The Waters and Earth are good in regard of one another, the waters are good to the land, and the land to the waters; the Earth would be without water to glue it together, even as dust, which would fly in our eyes to hinder our sight and choake us, and hinder our breathing in the Aire, <hi>Job</hi> 38. 38. and being all dry clods it would be unprofitable for tillage; therefore God giveth the waters to mollifie and soften it, <hi>Psal.</hi> So the Earth is good to the Sea waters; for it is a clenser and strainer, through which the saltnesse and unfruitfulnesse of the Waters are amended, and made<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62585:59"/>profitable, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.
25. Also as it maketh them serviceable, so doth the Earth make them medicinable, by his veynes, giving a vertue to make hot bathes, <hi>Gen.</hi>
36 24. so by it the waters are made profitable, serviceable, and medicinable.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, In regard of our selves which enjoy both; for both are our matter and substance of which we are made: For the Earth is the Meale and the Waters the Liquor, of both which the whole lump of Mankinde was made, and by both we are preserved alive, as the means appointed by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Lastly, in regard of God. For the Earth is Gods good Footstool, the Seas and Waters his Gallory or path to walk in, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 8. and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to be his Seat, on which, if he but stamp with his feet, as angry, both the Eart and Waters are troubled and doe quake; but if he tread gently, as pleased, they are quiet, and doe, as it were, leap, play, and dance for joy; but at his frowning and check the hills tremble, and the Seas are troubled and make a noyse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 48. In the 114. 5. we may see a Dialogue between the Sea and the Land touching this; For the Earth asketh the Waters, <hi>What ayleth thee that thou art troubled,</hi> &amp;c. The Waters reply and say, <hi>We fly at the presence and voyce of God;</hi> at which he saith, <hi>Tremble thou O Earth;</hi> for if his feet make the Seas goe out of course, then it is able to overturn the Earth, being his Foo stool.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Usus.</hi>
                  </note>The use of this is matter of meditation, both of Gods Mercie and Justice: If we anger God with sinne, the Earth is made to stagger and reele, the Seas to roare and swell, and the Fire to rage and burn on every side, and threaten our destruction: If we please him, they are made good means for our preservation: Where of this is the effect and application of this his goodnesse and approbation, to pray to God,
<hi>which is the hope of all which dwell on the Earth, and which remain on the broad Sea, Psal.</hi> 65. 5. that he will use the Sea to drown all our sinnes in it, <hi>Micha.</hi> 7. 9. and one day <hi>to make us to see all his goodnesse in the land of the living, Psal.</hi> 27. 13. for then we shall indeed see that all that God made for us is most absolute and good.</p>

               <p>IT was a benefit for the Earth to be disburdened from the great weight of huge waters, wherewith it was surcharged, even that breathing and ease from that burthen was a great blessing; but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth not God (so gracious is he) only to make it <hi>spectabilem,</hi> but also he will make it
<hi>speciosum;</hi> he will have it both conspirable, that it may be seen, and also conspicuall that it may be worthy the sight, that is, comely,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62585:60"/>sightly, and good and pleasant to behold. For, as
<hi>Esay</hi> saith, 40. 15. it was made and appeared at the first, it was but a dust heap, and as he calleth it, <hi>a measure of dust ashes,</hi> but now it is made habitable and a seat for men; then it was in its nature but as a Desart place, destitute of all necessaries to sustain them which are and remain dwelling in it; but now, being delivered from the naturall inconveniences
<hi>Tohu, Tohohu,</hi> it is become a store-house, replenished with all things for man and beast, <hi>mundus erat antea domus,</hi> as I have shewed you; for it had Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the sealing, the Waters as walls, the Earth as pavement, <hi>sed non erat in domo hac panis;</hi> it was as a Shepherds Cottage and wildernesse in which we might stay, but we must needs starve, if it had continued so: Wherefore as good no place as such a place, untill God had added this blessing to furnish it, as here we shall see.</p>
               <p>Therefore, that it might be <hi>penu,</hi> as the waters made it
<hi>promptuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> God here maketh it a storehouse and place of receipt, taking or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by his word that it might be <hi>locus conveniens ad vitam, ad victum, ad vestitum,</hi> and to that end doth he here open his mouth again, saith <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching which,
<note place="margin">1. The second opening of Gods mouth.</note>we will first consider of his second opening of his mouth.
<note place="margin">2. Of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note>Secondly, of the Argument and Contents of his Edict.
<note place="margin">3 Of his words, and works, which doe expresse it.</note>Thirdly, of his Words and Works, which doe expresse it.</p>
               <p>The iterating and doubling of his word, is a signe of his double care and love he bare to the Earth, which we must answer again by dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our love and care <hi>to please him with all our heart and soul Matth.</hi> 22. 10. If we look on all their works and compare this with the two before; and after we shall see heuseth but one speech to his place of Heaven, but he speaketh once or twice to this, and the reason is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Earth was cumbred with a double and indeed with a tripple inconvenience; for it was within emptie, without a bare and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed dust heap, and all overwrapped with waters to cover it: Therefore God having removed the waters with one word, now here he removeth the other inconveniences, giving her <hi>facultatem foecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditat is</hi> instead of emptinesse, <hi>&amp; amictum venustat is</hi> for the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; So this is the beautifull apparell of the Earth which the Poets say
<hi>Vesta</hi> gave her, rather doe we account this as a work of adorning, than a removing from it these native inconveniences which before it had; for these we call ornaments that may be removed or taken away, as we are whole though jewels and bracelets and chains be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, such are the living Creatures, as beasts and birds, &amp;c. which may be removed. But those things here named, grow fast unto the Earth and cannot be put away, but are as supplies to the indigence of nature. God cannot abide <hi>esse inners,</hi> that is, an idle being; and therefore, as he gave the light a power to send out beams, and the Heavens to send down influence and dewes, and to Rivers a motive power to runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the veins of the Earth, and so spring up: So here to keep the Earth from idlenesse, he in this work of distinction giveth it a power to shoot out Plants, which are as the beams and influences of the Earth, that it corrupt not in idlenesse. And thus much of the order and dependance of these words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:62585:60"/>
                  <note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>Now, for the form and argument of it, We shall see that the pupose of God herein, is partly to deck and trim up his work, and partly that it might be inriched with store for profit and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Which course we see usuall and agreeable to nature; for God provideth still breasts full of milk before the Child be born: And it is the manner and course of men in the world, before they will come to dwell in and possesse a house, they will first lay in their provision and necessaries for houshold.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Decree.</note>Touching the Decree, it containeth three parts, First, the Decree it self. Secondly, the Complement of it, <hi>and it was so.</hi> Thirdly, the Censure of God in his liking and approbation, that <hi>it is good.</hi> Of the first of these at this time.</p>
               <p>Wherein first of his speaking again, When we shall consider the virtue and force of Gods <hi>dixit,</hi> whereby he made and furnished all things, It must teach us, not <hi>despicere terras,</hi> not to look downward and depend on the Earth for food, nor yet <hi>suspicere stellas,</hi> that is, not gaze on the starres to trust in them for fruitfull increase; but it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to passe beyond all these, and know that all these blessings of the Earth come from God and his word, which saith <hi>Let the Earth bear forth, and it was so, non produxit terra antequam dixit Deus producat terra;</hi> for the nature of the Earth was at first empty, in the second degree dry and cold, which are <hi>mortiferae qualitates,</hi> and will rather kill than quicken and keep any seed, herb, or plant: But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this, if God call for a plenty, and say, <hi>Let the Earth bear,</hi> though there be no man to till the ground, no seed in the ground, no starres to give influence, no means now ordeined to cause it, yet it will bring forth fruit in aboundance: For at this time <hi>Adhuc</hi> Adam <hi>fuit Adama,</hi> that is, <hi>Agricola fuit adhuc ager,</hi> man was earth, and yet in the dust heap; therefore man was not the cause that the Earth did bear fruit, neither were the Heavens and Starres any cause, for they were not as yet made; for the Sunne, Moon, and all the Stars, are Juniors to the Herbs and Plants, and the very Grasse and Flower of the field Ancients to them all, <hi>quid ergo aspiras astra,</hi> saith one to starre-gazers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:62585:61"/>These plants and herbs are the influence, and starres and beams shooting out of the earth, as the Heavens hereafter have starres in them.</p>
               <p>It is strange that <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> which never knew
<hi>Moses</hi> writing, doth yet acknowledge this, That the earth brought forth all fruits meet for man and beast, before any living Creatures were on the earth. If then the fruits of the earth are not from any earthly cause, not from the earth it self, nor from man, nor from the starres we must needs conclude that they come from this <hi>dixit Deus,</hi> by the blessing of his word willing it to be done; the truth of which God hath sealed and signed up to us, by two reasons, the first <hi>St. Paul</hi> pleadeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
36.</p>
               <p>The second part is the Censure of approbation, saying, <hi>that it was good.</hi> In the <hi>Preach.</hi> 5. 8. the wise man being a King doth confesse that the fruitfullness of the earth is so necessarily good that no man, no not the King himself, can live or continue, but must miserably pine and perish without his fruit; and therefore <hi>St. James</hi> 5. 7. the Apostle calleth them, <hi>the precious fruits of the Earth,</hi> for which we wait as the hope of our life. There are three goods, as I told you before,
<hi>honestum, utile, jucundum,</hi> each of which contain in them a double goodnesse: All which three pair of several goodnesses we shall see in the earth
<hi>Bonum honestum,</hi> as a virtue morall which respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth true justice, equity, and faithfulnesse; and on the other side, benignity, goodnesse, mercy, and liberality, which we shall see in the earth.

This is the summe of the Argument.</p>
               <p>As for the words, in <hi>Dixit Deus</hi> is the Decree; then is the return; then the execution; then lastly, the approbation.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Dixit</hi> generally.
<note place="margin">Quest.</note>Some make this question, <hi>Why the lights were not brought forth before the fourth day, the three first dayes were without Sunne? God commandeth the Sunne and it riseth not, he closeth up the starres, as under a signet, Job</hi> 9. 7.
<note place="margin">Resp.</note>The question is thus answered. First he brings forth the things themselves, then the ordinary means; the Plant is first, then the seed, the means of the Plant; the Earth is first, then is it furnished with herbs; the Heavens must be before the Starres; there was light the first day, but the Sunne was not before the fourth day. The Heathen saith, that <hi>Sol est cor mundi;</hi> and the Physitions say, the heart is not first framed in the body, but the liver, and after the heart. God, without any means, brought forth the second cause, and by his power he brought forth the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the second cause. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Sol est mater, non author lucis.</hi> The Heathen saith, that <hi>deus est Plantarum,</hi> the Sunne is the god of Plants, but <hi>Rubus est senior Sole,</hi> the Sunne is not the god of the silly Bramble. The Persians, seeing nothing more glorious, did worship the visible Sunne. The AEgyptians under <hi>Orus,</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans under
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> did worship the Sunne. The very Jews did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Temples, and doe sacrifice to the Sunne and Moon and the whole host of Heaven; neglecting the service and worship due to God, who is the cause of the Sunne and of the light. They be not only his everlasting lamps; but, even as the Heathen say, they are his hammers to rarifie the Heavens: their influence is for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Plants and Mankinde, they joyn <hi>Homo &amp; Sol, Sol &amp; Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta:</hi> The Sunne concurreth to generation, this Philosophie teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and Divinity confesseth. Before God said, <hi>Let there be,</hi> and <hi>Let there appear to be:</hi> He causeth being; <hi>He causeth the morning to keep his</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:62585:64"/>
                  <hi>place, Job</hi> 38. 13. The Sunne makes not only things to appear, but even, as it were, to be. <hi>Spiritus incubans,</hi> the spirit hatched the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and <hi>dixit Deus,</hi> the word of God, brings forth the light: <hi>The Sunne of righteousnesse doth arise, and health shall be under his wings, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi</hi> 4. 2. He causeth the visible Sunne to shine upon the earth: Christ is the spirituall light, whereby the Heavens and all therein have their light. Christ is the Bridegrome in his marriage chamber,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 15. by whose permission the Sunne commeth forth as a Bridegrome also out of his chamber, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 4. These lights; though they have no tongue to speak unto us, yet by their beauty they poynt to our eyes, by their light they sing the glory and praise of God in our ears.</p>
               <p>Now of the tenor: Wherein we will consider three points, First, the things themselves: Secondly, the place: Thirdly, the uses of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1. The Lights.</note>For the first. There was light before; these are not <hi>lumina,</hi> but <hi>luminaria,</hi> they are not lights but lightners. <hi>Basil,</hi> upon the 1 <hi>Ezech.</hi> 4. saith, That the fire which was wrapped in the cloud, and the brightness that was about it, was the light of the Sunne: And <hi>Miscen,</hi> upon the 14.
<hi>Exodus</hi> 20. That the piller of the cloud, which gave light by night, was as the Moon.
<note place="margin">Light distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from Sunne and Moon.</note>I wish, as <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that you would rather use things manifest, than to be curious in things secret; although the schoolmen doe say, that the generation of these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is a corruption of the former Creation, which cannot be; for corruption is a defect; and this is no corruption, but rather a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the former Creation; and these latter lights are derived from the former. Light and day is not all one thing, and the Sunne is distinct from them both, the difference of them all <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth in one verse, <hi>At mid-day he saw a light, passing the brightnesse of the Sunne, shining round about him, Acts</hi> 26. 13. This light was <hi>lux vitae,</hi> there is <hi>lux diei, &amp; splendor solis.</hi> The day and the Sunne are not one, so saith Christ, the day is the durance of the light: <hi>luminare a lumine</hi> is there distinguished, for the Sunne is but the carriage of the light. the light and the Moon are distinct: the Moon every moneth lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth her old light, and puteth on a new, after the conjunction. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sunne nor the Moon are light of themselves, but the Sunne is the Chariot of light:
<hi>Paul,</hi> in the 2. <hi>Philippians</hi> 15. wisheth them <hi>to be pure and blamelesse, that among the wicked Nation they would shine as lights of the World. John</hi> saith, <hi>He was not that light, but he came to bear witnesse of the light, John</hi> 1. 8. It behoveth that in them which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse this light, there should be light, though they are not the light it self; for otherwise they be <hi>the blinde leaders of the blinde, Matth.</hi> 15. 14. The Fathers doe call the Apostles <hi>Apostoli lucis. Or</hi> is one thing in Hebrew, <hi>Maor</hi> is another; <hi>lumen</hi> is one thing, and
<hi>luminare</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; light is one thing, and that which giveth light is another. Things not durable shall be corrupt, and shall be brought forth: But when he purposeth a father matter, and a continuance as long as the world shall continue; as when he made the Heaven and the Earth, the Sunne and Starres, God saith <hi>sit, let therebe:</hi> he saith<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62585:64"/>in the singular <hi>sit, luminaria</hi> in the plurall, <hi>let there be lights.</hi> The Moon and the Starres are but as glasses, having no light in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but borrowing it from the Sunne.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 The placing of the Sun and the Starrs.</note>The second point of consideration, is the place which is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, in three regards, The first is in regard of God and his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who is the cause of them, and is above: <hi>Where is the way wherein light dwelleth? Job</hi> 38. 19. It is <hi>sursum,</hi> it is above.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, Their place is most convenient, in regard of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring of light to so large and spacious an house, as to the whole world: they doe hang in the Heavens as on a beam.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, By this means they are in safety, from the tyrannie and malice of man, for if they were in mens reach, they would pull the starres from their place, and God from his throne.
<hi>Adam</hi> did eato the fruit, though he were forbidden: <hi>Gilead is a City of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood: Priests are murtherers in the high-way by consent: there is villany in the house of Israel: there is whoredome of Ephraim, Osee</hi> 6. 8. But man cannot practise any of his envie against the starres which are placed on high in the Heavens. So that the placing of them above in the Heavens, doth signifie unto us, that the cause of them is above the Heavens, and the effect of their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating, and the providence God had of their safetie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3 Their use.</note>The third point to be considered is their use, which is manifold: The first is to separate the day and the night, which is orderly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the course of time; for there is no beauty without order. The day and the night were before divided, what needeth God now to make a second division here? You must understand that there are two dividings, the one is a division <hi>in duo,</hi> into day and night; the other is <hi>inter duo;</hi> the day is assigned to the Sunne, the night to the Moon: When the whole is parted, it is divided. The man in the 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. said to Christ, <hi>Bid my brother divide the inheritance with me:</hi> So that a thing is divided, <hi>tum separatur, &amp; cum separatum diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis assignatur.</hi> The Sunne is, as it were, the surveyor of mens worke, the Moon and Starres are our watch-men when we doe take our rest. <hi>The Lord giveth the Sunne for a light for the day, and the courses of the Moon and Starres for a light to the night, Jer.</hi> 31. 35. By the ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and descending of the Sunne, we have our hours, our dayes, our seasons: hereby we have dayes shorter and longer: and for that the Sunne had so many good qualities, and was so worthy a Creature, men of other Nations, and in times past, gave glory and worship to the Sunne, to it they did erect Altars, build Temples, and offered sacrifice.</p>
               <p>But <hi>non dominium sed ministerium dedit Deus Soli.</hi> The second use is for signes: <hi>Homer</hi> did say so much, that they were as signes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish us: It is good for Star-gazers, and out of this place they doe gather, that by the Starres they may foretell things to come.
<hi>Ambrose</hi> imputeth no fatall destiny, that cannot be shunned, to these signes, but rather that they are signes for direction. The Chaldees and the Persians, did foretell by the conjunction of Starres, that<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62585:65"/>there should be inundations, and that such things are inevitable; but for the most part, even then when they said should be wet there was the greatest drought: Hereby they cast figures, and shew mens Nativities; but the Lord saith, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 10. 2. <hi>Learn not the way of the Heathen, be not afraid for the signes of Heaven, though the Heathen be afraid of such.</hi> Most excellently saith the Lord, in the 44. <hi>Esay</hi> 25. <hi>I destroy the tokens of the Soothsayers, and make them, that conjecture, fools, and I make their knowledge foolishnesse:</hi> Their knowledge is foolish va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it is
<hi>inutiles querenti,</hi> and <hi>impossibilis profitenti.</hi> No inevitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny is to be ascribed to the Starres; for all that is, is in the hands of God. They are signes to the Husbandman, <hi>by them God giveth him discretion to sow and to reap in season, Esay</hi> 28. 26. They are signes to the Mariners, to them which sailed with <hi>Paul</hi> toward <hi>Rome, nor Sunne nor Moon appeared for many dayes, Acts</hi> 27. 20. They are signes to the Physition for his criticali dayes: The Sunne is a signe and as trumpet to the Beasts, which when it riseth, <hi>they doe retire to their dens; and then goeth man forth unto his work, Psal.</hi> 104. 22. They are also spirituall signes and holy signes; <hi>they that dwell in the uttermost parts of the Earth shall be afraid of thy signes, Psal.</hi> 65. 8. <hi>The Sonne of man at the latter day shall be as the light of the Heaven, Luke</hi> 17. 24. <hi>God will then shew wonders in Heaven, and tokens in the Earth, blood and fire and vapours of smoake, Acts</hi> 2. 19. So that these <hi>lumina,</hi> when we behold them, and think of the later day, are <hi>signa poenitentiae,</hi> they are
<hi>buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina poenitentiae;</hi> from whence are certain influences, the Moon to the waters, the Sunne to the Earth. If God be pleased, sweet is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Sunne, and sweet is the increase of the Moon, <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy</hi> 33.
14. But if God be angry, then is it otherwise.</p>
               <p>And <hi>they are for seasons,</hi> they are signes for place,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 47. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> bids the Israelites <hi>to remember the signes and Acts that God did in AEgypt, Deut.</hi> 11. 3. They are for times,
<hi>to every purpose there is a time, Preach.</hi> 8. 6. for oportunity is the very bud of time: They were for seasons <hi>inrebus sacris,</hi> in Gods feasts and holy-dayes: <hi>God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Moon for certain seasons, the Sunne knoweth his going down, Psal.</hi> 104. 19. By the Sunne the dayes are hotter and colder: The Moon is made to appear according to her season, the feasts are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Moon, the moneth is called after the name thereof,
<hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> 43. The Moon is a direction of the Passover, every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day is the Sabbath, <hi>state tempora sunt a Sole</hi> in things civill: Faires, meeting and ordaining Magistrates is by <hi>ordinata tempora.</hi> The Moon hath a short motion: the Sunne hath a great wheele for his whole course in a year, for his compasse by dayes: There is the morning Starre shining from the end of the night to the beginning of the day; the evening starre, the end of the day to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the night: The Sunne in the day, the Moon in the night, are for their seasons: the revolution of the Sunne is in a year, of the Moon in a moneth. The Sunne did rise to
<hi>Jacob,</hi> after he had wrastled with the Angell, <hi>chap.</hi> 32. 31. The Passover was to be offered at Even, <hi>at the going down of the Sunne in the moneths of Abib,</hi>

                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. <hi>begin.</hi> So that the Sunne and the Moon are for seasons, as it is in the 104. <hi>Psal. God,</hi> saith <hi>Job in his</hi> 26. <hi>chapter</hi> 13. <hi>Hath furnished the Heavens and framed the crooked serpent,</hi> which is taken for the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack. God saith to <hi>Job, Canst thou bring forth Mazaroth in their time, Canst thou guide Arcturus with his sonnes? Job.</hi> 38. 32. The Sunne runneth about in a day; and in a year it goeth to each Tropick: <hi>In accessu</hi> begins the Spring; <hi>in decessu</hi> the Winter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">For themselves</note>They are for illumination, to be a light, that is to give light; to be a light even at midnight. The Sunne is a light perpetually: when it is absent from us, it giveth light elsewhere; to us it giveth light while we doe need it: It is for us, so that we may say to the lights <hi>sit vos non vobis,</hi> they are for the Earth and for the Heavens: they are for lights in the Firmament, and to give light upon the Earth. <hi>Sol est propter terram,</hi> this is an honor to us, and humility in them. <hi>The Sunne commeth forth as a Bridegrome out of his chamber, and rejoyceth like almighty man to runne his race, Psal.</hi> 19.
5. So that it is for the Earth; it was made to serve and lighten the earth: take thou therefore heed, <hi>lest thou lift up thy eyes unto Heaven, and when thou seest the Sunne and the Moon, and the Starres, with all the hoste of Heaven, thou shouldst be driven to worship and to serve them, Deut.</hi> 4. 19. It cutteth off their adoration; for <hi>creavit eos in ministerium cunctis Gentibus. Sol o Deus est famulus. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na est ancilla tua, ambo sunt in ministerium homini: Non sunt conservi, sed servi hominum: Non sunt cum terra, sed propter terram.</hi> Great then is their humilitie to us, which are subject to corruption, whose bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and sisters are the very worms. So that the Sunne, in his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry name in Hebrew, doth import that it is not <hi>Deus,</hi> but <hi>servus homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi> At <hi>Joshua's</hi> commandement <hi>the Sunne stayed in Gibeon, and the Moon in the valley of Aielon, Joshua</hi> 10. 12.
<hi>Isaiah</hi> showed this sign that <hi>Hezechiah</hi> should restore his health, <hi>he brought the Sunne back again ten degrees;</hi> God then sheweth great favour unto man, that can make the Sunne to stand still and retire back again, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 9. These Lights then were assigned to divide the day from the night; their Function is for the inferior Earth, and the superior Heaven: they were ordained for the decking of the Celestiall part, and for the use of man, and lastly, for the glory of God. They doe serve for the Earth, and they doe shew forth Gods praise, yea, <hi>the starres of the morning praise God together, Job.</hi> 38. 7. <hi>The Sunne, and the Moon, and all the bright Starres shall praise him, Psal.</hi> 148. 3.</p>

                  <hi>from the father of lights, with whom is no variablenesse, James</hi> 1. 17. The Earth is immovable, yet subject to alteration: the Starres are in their motion immutable: they were made to lighten the Earth, to rule the day and the night; they were not made to be adored. <hi>Austin</hi> maketh this dialogue between these lights and man,
<hi>Creator est supra me &amp; te, qui fecit me &amp; te, me prote, &amp; te pro se:</hi> this is spoken by the Sunne: God made these lights for man, he made man for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: <hi>David,</hi> in the 8. <hi>Psalme</hi> 3. saith,
<hi>When I behold thine Heavens and the works of thy fingers, the Moon and the Starres which thou hast ordeyned; What is man, say I then, that thou art mindfull of him? or the sonne of man, that thou regardest him? Thou hast made him little lower than God, and hast crowned him with glory and worship: thou hast given him dominion over the works of thine hands:</hi> yet is he, by
<hi>Abrahams</hi> confession, <hi>but dust; The worms are his kinsfolk,</hi> saith <hi>Job; The words of his mouth are iniquitie and deceit,</hi> saith
<hi>David, Psal.</hi> 36. 3. <hi>Creata sunt omnia per Deum Patrem, ordinata sunt per Verbum, ornata per Spiritum. His spirit hath garnished the Heavens, Job</hi> 26. 13. <hi>Let all the Kings of the Earth sing the praises due unto the Lord, Psal.</hi> 138. 5. <hi>Austin</hi> saith well, What greater obedience can there be, <hi>dixit,</hi> and <hi>facta sunt?</hi> What greater love can there be then <hi>quod pro nobis facta sunt:</hi> Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all the Nations of the Earth be thankfull to the Lord, who hath made us and them, and them for us. Of what are they made? surely of somthing: <hi>sit lux,</hi> that was of nothing; <hi>fecit stellas,</hi> that was of somthing: He created the form and formed the matter; <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit</hi> and <hi>fuit</hi> is not all one: the matter is the light, the Heavens is the form: <hi>God hath stretched out the Heavens, which are strong, as a moulten glasse, Job</hi> 37. 18. They are made, by the best opinion, of water and light.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Sunne and the Moon.</note>Now what is made. Two great lights the Sunne and the Moon, which are as a great fire, and the Starres are as little sparkles: as two great torches, and as many little wax candles: The Moon is lesser than many starres, according to Astrologie, which <hi>Moses</hi> doth not impugne: though it be a lesser body, yet is a greater light in respect of the starres, and a lesser in regard of the Sunne, and so saith <hi>Moses. Moses was very great in the land of Egypt,</hi> not great of personage, but great in favour, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11. 3. The greatest Apostle is not taken in the quantity, but in the quality: the great men, are said men of dignity, of account, that are in much favour. <hi>Paul</hi> counteth himself the least of the Apostles, not as one of lowest stature, but of least desert: <hi>David</hi> was great with God, not in that he had a large and spatious body, but for that God did love and favour him. So there is
<hi>alia gloria Solis, alia Lunae, alia Stellarum; for one starre differeth from another in glorie,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 41. Here he speaketh of the lights, not of the celestiall bodies, wherein he sheweth himself skilfull in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks: <hi>He was learned in all the wisdome of the Egyptians, Acts</hi> 7. 22. so that he could have discoursed among the Astrologers of the quantities of the celestiall bodies, but here by naming the greater and lesser light, he doth instruct the very simple. The light<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62585:67"/>must be great, for the house wherein it must hang, is the whole world. There must be two, because they must serve for two seas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions: they are <hi>lumine impares,</hi> because they are <hi>usu impares:</hi> There is <hi>luminare majus</hi> and <hi>luminare minus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Sunne.</note>The greater is the Sunne, which is the President of the day: the Persians say that it is the lightner of all other lights, <hi>luminare omnium luminum,</hi> and that it is the Prince and Governour of light. The starres doe get up to the top of the Epicycle, in his absence they doe mourn, and meet him again with joy in their Epicycle, for they doe owe allegiance to the Sunne. It hath two qualities, light to direct, and heat to cherish. <hi>He is like a Bridegrome and like a Giant,</hi> saith
<hi>David: Pulchritudinem sponsi vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus per lucem, vim gigantis per calorem,</hi> saith <hi>Austin</hi> upon the 19. Psalm 5.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Moon.</note>
                  <hi>The lesser is to rule the night, At the rule of the Moon the Sunne doth not murmur, but it doth give place unto the Moon, being inferior.</hi> Here is greater obedience and humili y used then men doe use in this age; there is no obedience in the inferior to the superior, but murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and desire of equality: The Sunne hath the rule of the day, the Moon the dominion of the night, both are content: In Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship there is no fellowship:
<note place="margin">The three first nights without light.</note>Before this fourth night the three nights had no light, but were meerly dark: The Moon now shineth in the night, it is the Sunnes deputy; In the night it is comfortable in the Sea by navigation, on the land by journey.

In the time of her rule is the time of ease and of silence. She hath a milde light; she shineth <hi>lumine repercusso,</hi> with a borrowed light.

The starres fixed have their tabernacles:
<hi>God that made the world, and all things that therein is; He is the Lord of Heaven and of Earth, he dwelleth not in Temples made with hands Acts</hi> 17.
24. <hi>The Israelites took up the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Moloch and the Starre of their God Remphan, figures which they made to worship, Acts</hi> 7. 43.

<hi>Job</hi> in his 38. chapter 32. <hi>Canst thou bring forth Mazaroth in their time?</hi> This Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaroth is taken for the Zodiack: <hi>Canst thou guide Arcturus with his Sonnes?</hi> The starre Arcturus is the Northern Pole, in the tayle of <hi>Ursamajor;</hi> in the Zodiack are the twelve signes, whereof one containeth many starres: from thence there is a correspondencie in

<hi>Galaxia</hi> or <hi>Via lactea,</hi> is held by some to be the passage of the Sunne; by others, the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the radiations of many starres, from thence is moisture. There is mention of Orion and the Pleiades, <hi>Job</hi> 38
31. Orion, when it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, bringeth in Winter: sweet are the influence of the Pleiades, <hi>delitiae sunt Pleiadum:</hi> When those seven starres appear, the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Taurus,</hi> they bring in the spring and pleasant flowers. <hi>It is even God,</hi> saith <hi>Job the</hi> 9. <hi>chap.</hi> 11.
<hi>verse, that maketh the starres, Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades:</hi> And
<hi>Amos</hi> 5 8. <hi>In the dogge dayes the starres of the nature of a dogge, doe rule.</hi> Arcturus, as I said before, is the Northern Pole, this starre especially hath a principall use for direction to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners where ever they goe; for Arcturus and his sonnes is their chief mark, the load stone will ever look toward that. They have an use in their influence, which is especially in the night. By Gods mercy the Mariner, by means of the loadstone, shall know which way to sayle, which starre <hi>Arcturus, with his sonnes, the Lord doth guide, Job</hi> 38. 32. As for the influence, <hi>Sweet is the increase of the Sunne, and of the Moon, Deut.</hi> 33. 14. <hi>Regard yee mee not because I am black, the Sunne hath looked upon me, Cant.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Solardet, The Sunne burned up Jonahs gourd, Jonas</hi> 4. 8.

By their light we number, we measure, and order the Earth: It receiveth no light by mans industry: this light is <hi>lucerna pedibus,</hi> by them God doth impregnate, and extracteth the fruits: they rule the day and the night, and they serve for the use of man. <hi>Abimelech lay in ambush in the dark night, but he rose as soon as the Sunne was up, to fight with Gaal, Judge</hi> 9. 33. So they have <hi>imperium &amp; ministerium,</hi> the evening and morning is ruled by the Starres, the night by the Moon, and the day by the Sunne, yet they doe serve the use of man: by the devotion of the Sunne the dayes are longer and shorter; by them the light is separated from the darknesse; by the course of Heaven we have hot and cold dayes; the year, the moneth, the day, are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and distinguished by the Hoste of Heaven,
<hi>Ezechiel</hi> 31. 1. The Moon in the full is the Summer of the Moneth, the conjunction is, as it were, the Winter.</p>
               <p>They are to divide light and darknesse; this is for mans sake in respect of the Creatures: The Sunne is the protector of man; and when he ruleth, it is the time of labour: but when the Moon ruleth, the night commeth and restoreth strength: <hi>Who may abide the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the day of the Lord?

               <p>Now of the Approbation, <hi>and God saw that it was good.</hi> No evill is to be ascribed to the constellation of any starre; for all the starres that God made are good: The good of the light is visible, there is in it a morall goodnesse; for <hi>malus odit lucem, &amp; quaerit tenebras:</hi> The Adulterer, the Theef, the Murtherer, are the Children of darknesse; so that in light there is a morall goodnesse. Therein also there is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant good,
<hi>The light is a pleasant thing, it is a good thing to the eyes to see the Sunne, Preach.</hi> 11. 7. Herein <hi>bonum</hi> and <hi>jucundum</hi> doe meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Falshood and wickednesse dwelleth in dark places, but <hi>veritas non quaerit angulos. Fear was upon the Mariners when neither Sunne nor Starres in many dayes appeared, Acts</hi> 27 20. But <hi>Sol</hi> and solace dwell together: they have <hi>bonum utile.</hi> Their use and profit is to light; the Sunne is <hi>clavus vitae,</hi> by them we have direction to judge and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne. Hereby is the managing of dayes and of nights, <hi>alternatio tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum, &amp; vicissitudo rerum:</hi> Hereby is a time to sow and a time to reap; Hereby is confusion of times avoided. So <hi>God saw it was good</hi> in all goodnesse. <hi>God maketh his Sunne to arise upon the evill and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust, Math.</hi> 5. 45. So that the light is an argument of Gods goodnesse.</p>

There is a pleasure in the taking of them by fowling to the meaner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and by hawking to Princes &amp; the better sort.

                  </note>As for
<hi>honestum bonum,</hi> remember the little Bee. In birds we have matter of instruction for manners: Whereby we may learn matter to be avoided, and to follow. There are unclean fowls as well as clean: The unclean are described in the 11. of <hi>Leviticus</hi> 13. as the Eagle, the Vulture, the Kite, the Hawke, &amp;c. The ravening of these fowls we may learn to avoid. In the little Bee we may learn labour and good order, good government: The Bees have the most ancient Common-wealth, banishing from their Hive the idle Drone; all good policie is also to be gathered from them. Of the Eagle we doe learn true nobilitie, by his soaring and mounting up on high, as <hi>Ambrosae</hi> saith on the 39. of <hi>Job</hi> 30. <hi>habemus animum sursum sapientem:</hi> as by there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Eagles beak and strength, we learn to renew our wayes: look in the 1. of <hi>Micah</hi> 16. where the Prophet saith, <hi>Make thee bald, and shave thee for thy delicate children, enlarge thy baldnesse as the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle:</hi> Thence may you gather the pattern of true Nobility; for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62585:71"/>history doth report, that the Eagle causeth the baldnesse of his breast, the better to keep warm his young: all the evening, to keep himself the warmer, he getteth some bird, and sleepeth upon it all night; in the morning he doth not prey upon it, but suffereth it to flie away: and because the Eagle will be sure not to meet that bird again, when he seeth which way it flyeth, the Eagle taketh some other way. God sheweth his providence in the old Testament to the Ravens, in the Gospel to the Sparrows; though the one be ravenous and the other base, two dozen three half pence: See the 147.
<hi>Psalm</hi> 5. much more then will he regard man: <hi>Sweet is the song of the Turtle, Cant.</hi> 2. 12. We have an example in the Stork for kindenesse to his Damme. We learn sincerity and innocencie from the Dove, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.
16. And <hi>Salomon</hi> compareth, in the 1. <hi>Canticles</hi> 15. the Churches beauty to the eyes of a Dove. By the returning of the Swallow and Crane in their season, as in the spring, we ought to remember to return from a sinfull life: <hi>The Stork in the Aire know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her appointed times: the Turtle, the Crane, and the Swallow observe their comming, Jeremy</hi> 8. 7.
<hi>David,</hi> the better to expresse his mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and solitarinesse, in
<hi>Psal.</hi> 102. saith, <hi>I am like a Pellican of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, like an Owle of the Desart, as a sparrow alone upon the house top.</hi> In the Phenix lastly may be resembled the resurrection: Our good is in their good.</p>
               <p>Fowls also of some sort are good for his Justice, some doe foretell calamity, and are the ministers of destruction, <hi>Ezcchiel</hi> 39.
17. When <hi>Esay</hi> foretold his desolation to the Citie, <hi>It shall be a Court for Ostriches, the shrich-Owle shall rest there, the Owle shall make her nest there, the Vultures also shall be gathered together, Esay</hi> 34. 14.

<note place="margin">Gods blessing is reall.</note>God blesseth us otherwise, for his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is reall; for when God blesseth, <hi>he leaveth a blessing behinde him, Joel</hi> 2. 14. <hi>destroy not the vine, for a blessing is in it, Esay</hi> 65. 8. our blessing is but of windie words.

The eccho of Gods
<hi>benedixit</hi> is <hi>benefecit: bene precari &amp; nihil praestare,</hi> is mans blessing: <hi>bene precari &amp; praestare,</hi> is Gods blessing. His blessings are infinite; <hi>The water droppeth out of his bucket, and his seed shall be in many waters, Numb.</hi> 24. 7. God is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse it self, Christ is called <hi>the Sonne of the blessed.</hi> But among all his blessings here is meant that which is spoken of <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 25. namely <hi>the blessing of the brests and of the womb,</hi> which is the power of fruitfulnesse and of fertility.

                  <hi>Edictum est hoc conservationis,</hi> it hath four parts.
<note place="margin">1. Naturall love.</note>First, natural love of the engenderer to the thing engendred. <hi>As an Eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her byrds, stretcheth out her wings, taketh them and beareth them upon her wings, Deut.</hi> 32. 11. yea even <hi>the Dragons draw out the breast and give suck to their young, but the Daughters of my People is become cruel like the Ostriches in the wildernesse,</hi> saith <hi>Jeremy, Lament.</hi> 4. 3.

<note place="margin">2. The natural knowledge of their meat.</note>The second point of their preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is the natural and ordinary knowledge of their meat; As the Bee flyeth to the flower, the land fowl to the seed, the water fowl to the root; the Crab watcheth the Oysters gaping, he knoweth <hi>pabulum &amp; latibulum,</hi> thev know their place, <hi>the Sparrow findeth her an house, and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young, Psal.</hi> 84. 2. and therefore they make their nest hard without and soft within, <hi>The Dove maketh her nest in rocks to be in safety, Jer.</hi>
48. 24.
<note place="margin">3 Knowledge of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note>The third part of preservation is, that they know their enemies: the Dove
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62585:73"/>feareth the Kite, not the Swan; the Partridge the Hawke, not the Goose; and the fishes flie the Pike. The Bee hath knowledge of her sting, therefore in her anger she stingeth: the birds trust some in their beaks, some in their talents, and the weak and simple Dove tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in her wings. They have knowledge of time &amp; place; the Stork knoweth her season; the Swallow never is seen but in the Summer; the Cock croweth certainly at his hours: <hi>Ex Avihus est praesagium Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li;</hi> when the Crane taketh up a stone, and flies with it in his foot, it is a signe of a storm.
<note place="margin">4. Knowledge of their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</note>The fourth part of preservation is, that they doe know their medicines. <hi>The Eagle buildeth his nest on high, as in a tower:</hi> the Hawke to get her feathers flyeth with a south winde, <hi>she stretcheth out her wings to the South, Job</hi> 39. 29. <hi>Plumescit vento Australi;</hi> the Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low cureth her eye sight by the Celandine; the Ibis teacheth us to take a glister; the Sea horse learned us the blood-letting, for when he feeleth himself full of corrupt blood, he pricketh himself upon a sharp reed.</p>

<hi>The fowls should multiply upon the Earth, fishes,</hi> by shoals, <hi>did fill the waters,</hi> and the spawn of fishes covered the waters. It were dangerous and troublesome if the fowls had so many egges as the fishes have spawns, <hi>non est tanta vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucrum luxuries quanta est piscium.</hi> God still regarded man, he would not have the Aire pestered, therefore he restrained them only for to multiply. <hi>Sol &amp; homo generant hominem,</hi> saith Philosophic: but Divinity saith <hi>benedictio Dei &amp; homo generant hominem, illa &amp; pisces ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant pisces, illa &amp; aves generant aves.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods blessing.</note>It is his blessing that giveth food to the hungrie, cloaths to the naked, riches to any man, <hi>It is not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor that maketh rich, nor strength that getteth victory, Proverbs</hi>
10. 22. <hi>It is in vain for man to rise early, to lye down late, and to eate the bread of sorrow, for mans state is in Gods providence, Psal.</hi> 127.
<hi>Children are the inheritance of the Lord, the fruit of the womb is his reward,</hi> in the same <hi>Psal.</hi> By study and Gods blessing commeth learning.

                  <note place="margin">A spiritual Analogie.</note>There is here also observed by the Fathers, a spiritual Analogie in <hi>dominamini.</hi> In man there is a spirit and a soul; in him there is also Earth: the cares of the body ought to be lesse than those of the soul, <hi>est enim anima in homine coelum, corpus autem coenum,</hi> saith <hi>Basil, non sit coenum coelo superius, sed sit coelum coeno superius,</hi> Let the soul have dominion over the body and the concupiscence thereof; the body is earthly given to lust, anger, envie, pride. Here they admonish us to subdue these beastly affections, and to tame the savagenesse of our corrupt nature. The whole nature of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and things of the Sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of the nature of man; <hi>but the tongue can no man tame, it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly evill, full of deadly poyson:</hi> this place doe they allege out of the 3. <hi>James</hi> 8. And as <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>that the tongue should be tamed from evil speaking, malicious slandering, back-byilng, lying, and dissembling:</hi> so say they (and that very well) that all the brutish affections ought to be tamed and subdued; that so the soul might reign in the body, and the body be subject to the soul.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Answer.</note>True it is, that
<hi>Adam</hi> was created immortal, yet having a possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be immortal: Thereupon the School-men say there is a double immortality, <hi>posse non mori fuit Adami, mori non posse est Dei;</hi> for Christ only, <hi>who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords</hi> hath this immortality, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16. which is bestowed upon us by way of reward through Christ our Saviour, whereby our nature is ingrasted in the divine nature of the second immortality; for
<hi>the first man Adam was made a living soul, and the last Adam was made a quickning spirit,</hi> that is, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from Heaven the spirit of life;
<hi>the first was of the Earth earthly, the second of the Heaven heavenly,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. <hi>Adam</hi> was created with a possibility of immortality; the part immortal of mans creation was from God; but through mans disobedience and ambition, when he did eat of the forbidden fruit of good and evill, <hi>God shut him out of the garden of Eden, lest he should take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever, chap.</hi> 3. 22. whereby
<hi>Adam</hi> was deprived of life; for it was said in the 2. <hi>chap.</hi>
17. <hi>When in that day he did eat of the forbidden fruit, he should dye the death.</hi> So that by mans disobedience man became mortal, who before, in the state of his innocencie, had a possibility of immortality, for then he had the Image of God perfectly, <hi>but by sinne came death, per peccatum mors:</hi> and so by mans transgression Gods Image was defaced; <hi>for by one man sinne entred into the World, and death by sinne, and so death went over all men by this Adams sinne, even Babes were subject to death, though they had no actuall sinne, Rom.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>And life came to Mankinde through one that is Christ Jesus: As by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one the fault came on all men to condemnation; so by the justifying of one, the grace abounded to all men, to the justification of life,</hi> the 18. of the foresaid chapter: For, by him,
<hi>this mortall must put on immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, this corruptible incorruption, for Christ swallowed up death in victorie, saying Death, where is thy sting? Hell, where is thy victorie?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. Man was not immortall by himself, but the life he had God gave him: In the state of his innocencie he had heat and moisture, which God breathed into him when he breathed life,
<hi>chap.</hi> 2. 7. and therefore man needed even then food to preserve heat and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture. Man before was immortall and his meat uncorrupted, but by mans fall, man became mortal, subject to death, so that both man and mans meat were corrupted; and <hi>Adam</hi> was a debtor to the flesh to satisfie his hunger. Before God said <hi>Dominamini</hi> all beasts and fowls were <hi>peculium Dei,</hi> Gods proper store: The trees and fruits were before, but this is mans warrant, To touch any thing, any tree, any herb, for their meat.

                     <hi>There is a man, to whom God hath given riches and treasures, and he wanteth nothing that he can desire; but God giveth him not power to eat, thereof, but a strange man shall eat it up, Preach.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Elisha</hi> told the King, <hi>That he should see with his eyes the great plenty that should be in Samaria, but he should not eat thereof,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 19. <hi>Though a man have aboundance, yet his life standeth not in his riches, Luke</hi> 12. 15. and therefore in that chapter, <hi>what availed it the rich man to have much fruit, many barns, and much goods layed up for many yeers, when that even in the same night they should fetch away his soul?</hi> Then whose were those things which he had provided? <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di vobis ut sint in escam,</hi> There is the fruition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>In escâ tria sunt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>The first is a content of the appetite, which avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth famine; for <hi>when God shall break the staffe of bread, men shall eate and not be satisfied, Levit.</hi> 26. 26.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Sometimes also <hi>the men of this world have their portion in this life, they have their bellies filled with Gods hidden treasure, Psal.</hi> 17. 14. It is Gods curse <hi>to have sown much and bring in little, to eat and not to have enough, to drink and not to be filled, to be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed and not to be warm, Aggey</hi> 1. 6.
<note place="margin">3.</note>The third benefit in meat is, that it nourisheth, <hi>While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of God was kindled against the people who lusted, and God smote them with an exceeding great plague, Numb.</hi> 11. 33. <hi>The meat of the wicked in his bowels was turned, he hath devoured substance, and shall vomit it, for God shall draw it out of his belly, Job</hi> 20. 14. So that to eat, to be satisfied, and to be nourished, are three several benefits; as to have and not to eat, to have and eat and not to be satisfied, to have eat and be satisfied, and not to be nourished, are three several curses and plagues. Some there are, who though they eat never so much or never so good meat, are ever lean; whereas others are fat, though their dyet be small and of the basest sort: For though that <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellows did eat pulse and drink water for ten dayes, <hi>yet at the end<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62585:81"/>of the ten dayes they were fairer and in better liking than they which did eat of the portion of the Kings allowance, Daniel</hi> 1. 15. <hi>God hath created meats to be received with giving of thanks, neither is any to be refused, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sanctified by the word of God and prayer,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. So that in a word, as Gods benefits descend upon us, so our prayer and praises must ascend up to God for the same.</p>

                  <p>It may seem at the first sight, that God alloweth men and beasts the same dyet. Things planted and sowed by Husbandry are for Men: but that which the Earth giveth of her own nature, without tillage, as <hi>quae sunt spontanea,</hi> are for Beasts: The seed in Corne, the fruit in Trees is allowed unto Man, the stalks to Beasts: So that there is not the same allowance unto both, although both had their allowance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Et fuit sic; And it was so.</hi> Some doe aske whether the Beasts, as Lyons; the Birds, as Hawks, lived upon their prey in the state of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie?

                     <note place="margin">Three things hence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted.</note>Hence we are to learn three things.
<note place="margin">1.</note>That men would survey their works as God doth here, how great and how excellent they are; this is perfect wisdome and virtue, though commonly men set forth their rude works for perfect, without any survey: For <hi>Salomon,</hi> though he were the wisest man of his age, yet could he say, <hi>that when he looked upon all the works that his hand had wrought, and in the travail he had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to doe, and behold all was but vanity and vexation of spirit, Preach.</hi> 2. 11. When God seeth man's wicked wayes, <hi>he will reprove him, and set them in order; to them that dispose their way aright God will shew his salvation, Psal.</hi> 50. 21. This is a rumination and a consideration of our works, which are unperfect, to reform them, and of Gods works, which being <hi>good,</hi> were, being accomplished,
<hi>very good.</hi> Oh men glorifie God and follow him, he is the patern of goodnesse it self. Therefore <hi>let men see and know, let them consider and understand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the holy one of Israel hath created it, Esay</hi> 41. 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, Hence we learn to rectifie our judgments, and to see as God did see. Divers men have an itch in the tongue, who will finde fault in this or that which God hath made; this commeth to passe when men will seem to see more than God himself did see. When that God did trie every work of his here seven times in this chapter; <hi>as for the words of the Lord, they are pure as silver, tryed in a furnace of earth, fined seven fold, Psal.</hi> 12. 6. So are his works also; and this is a bridle to our licentiousness, to suspend our judgment, and not to finde fault with Gods works. God hath said <hi>they were very good, habent er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go bonitatem etsi nobis ignotam.</hi> Divers things are good in their place, divers in their time: Fire in the cold of Winter is good, in the heat of Summer it is not so good: Water in the Summer is good. It is Gods<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62585:82"/>curse and a great grief <hi>to eat in darknesse, Preach.</hi> 5. 17. In time things be good, <hi>all things have their time, Preach.</hi> 3. In a word let every one say thus with himself, God hath seen this or that good, I silly man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see it otherwise. <hi>Omnia sunt munda mundis, &amp; sicomnia bona bonis,</hi> all things are clean to the clean, and all things good to the good. God createth good things, he ordereth evil things: the thing is not ill, but the ill applying is evil, not the power. There is <hi>potest as ad infestandum.</hi> if it be applyed to the Malefactor, it is even <hi>bonum justitiae. Sic non est dedecus culpae sine dedecore vindictae.</hi> God saith, <hi>It shall be well with the just, for they shall eat the fruit of their works; but woe be to the wicked, for it shall be evill with them, Esay</hi> 3. The punishing the wicked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding the just is good; <hi>for we know that all things work to the best un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that love God, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. If any thing be amisse, the evill is in man, not in God: God hath made us good, but by <hi>Adams</hi> transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and our daily sinne, we are evill: <hi>It is our iniquities that hath se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated between us and our God; it is our sinnes that have hid his face from us, Esay</hi> 59. 2. <hi>and Jer.</hi> 5. 25. Say not then this is ill or that is ill, but say I am ill and I am wicked. God, who made all things, could best see that every thing was <hi>very good:</hi> but either by ignorance or by ill desert we are dymme sighted.</p>

                     <note place="margin">3.</note>Lastly, For imitation we must see as God did, that we may see our works good: <hi>Bonitas bonitatum, &amp; omnia bonitas</hi> was the state of the first creation: By sinne it was that

<hi>vanitas vanitatum, &amp; omnia vanitas;</hi> and therefore let us be warie. Gods deeds were visible, they were not good words on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but good gifts: let not us say only <hi>ecce dixi,</hi> but let our acts be good to the needy with
<hi>ecce dedi:</hi> let us imitate God in that his goodnesse. There are two good things come from man, the one in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Knowledge, temperance, love,</hi> &amp;c. The other in the 4. to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
14. <hi>to communicate to the afflicted: benefacite &amp; communicate</hi> is the summe of all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</hi> In the former dayes there was creation of nothing, a disposition and ordering of things created, and an adorning of things ordered: Here is an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of all his works. God, before man was, observed the dayes and the number, but here he delivereth unto man the Kalender of times, which we have received and shall be received to the worlds end. The evening goeth before the morning: rest is in the evening, labor in the morning, to the which man is ordained: After this his last work cometh the seventh day, the day of rest. God he resteth not in the waters, nor in the Earth; he resteth not in the Heavens: but to conclude with the excellent saying of St. <hi>Austin: Requiescit Deus in homine, ut homo in Deo requiescat,</hi> God took his rest in man, that man might take his rest for ever with God: Which God of his mercy grant us all; to whom be all honor, glorie, and praise, world without end.</p>

               <p>Touching the first, as it is contained in three verses, so in it there are three parts, or members to be marked.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>In the first, The Holy Ghost standeth upon the perfection of Gods works.</p>

                  <note place="margin">3.</note>In the third, That he instituted that day, and sanctified it, to be a sabboth for ever to be used, observed, and kept.</p>
               <p>Which three parts doe depend one upon another; for God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perfected all, he rested, and in that rest he blessed the seventh day, and instituteth the Sabboth: these are the three branches of the first part: The first whereof I will handle at this time.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1. He perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted all when man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>
                  <hi>Moses,</hi> by way of sequell, telleth us, by joyning the perfection of things to mans Creation: That is a singular and an honourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in that behalf unto man: For recounting the perfection of all Creatures presently after mans making, he inferreth that they were not perfect, but defective before; for untill man was made, that

                  </gap>, that wheel of generation <hi>and course of nature</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of St. <hi>James</hi> spake 3. 6. which never stood still. God took no rest before, nor made holy-day, because there was no end nor perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his work untill man was made; Insomuch as God may seem to have made such a vow as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Psal.</hi> 132. 4, 5. That he would not suffer himself to take any rest, until he had found that earth of which he would make man, and had placed him in the World; which argueth that there was a defect and imperfection, and as yet something to be supplyed, for the Earth lacked, and therefore looked for her possessor, which was man, who carried therefore the Earth in his name, that he might shew that the earth depended on him;
<note place="margin">The Host of Creatures.</note>for the perfection of Heaven and Earth is in him, who as he was <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps Terrae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Captain.</note>so was he <hi>Infans Coeli,</hi> one born to inherit Heaven also; for seeing Heaven is a body and capable of a body, it must needs be that it was not made only for spirits, but for a body which was to be made: Therefore in that he saith, <hi>Thus were the Heavens and the Earth perfected,</hi> he sheweth that their perfection was suspended, and they held as unperfect and not compleat, until man was made.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>the Heavens were made,</hi> 1. 19. yet until now they were not perfected: There was <hi>Urim,</hi> as the Hebrews say, but there was not <hi>Thummim: i.</hi> there was <hi>light,</hi> but there was not <hi>the perfection of light.</hi> Thus then were the Heavens and the Earth perfected; for though there was a power in God to make more Creatures, and create more things besides these; yet note, he maketh his full point, and saith, all is perfected, which is that (<hi>consummatum est</hi>) of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Thus much generally for the copulation <hi>&amp; sic.</hi> Now to descend<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62585:85"/>to the particulars, we see thy are distributed into two joynts.</p>
               <p>

               <p>That a thing be made perfect, there are required two degrees of perfection, which are opposite to the double imperfection, spoken of in the former Chapter,
<note place="margin">Barrennesse, Emptinesse.</note>called
<hi>Tohu, Tobohu,</hi> the one being an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward perfection opposite to barrennesse and emptinesse without: the other is inward, opposite to rudenesse and deformity within.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, a due supply of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent furniture, and the accessory of needfull ornaments which being added it is also outwardly perfect; both which you may see in a body: for when a mans body is rightly knit together in every joynt with good colour and countenance, he hath his first inward perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of nature; but so long as there is nakednesse, there is yet a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and want outwardly: But being adorned with jewels and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, it hath then the outward perfection also.</p>

                  </gap>, for by that means every room is furnished and adorned.</p>
               <p>The like order we may observe in Heaven and Earth; First they were imperfect, nothing done nor disposed; then they were <hi>facta,</hi> that is, perfectly made and disposed, as great, spacious, and stately rooms as yet empty and void; but now <hi>being filled with the hosts of of them,</hi> then they are perfectly furnished indeed.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> the beauty of Heaven and Earth: but the propriety of the word in the original tongue importeth Armies, or Hosts, or Bands;
<note place="margin">Quest.</note>Whereupon the question is,
<hi>Why Moses doth expresse the fullnesse of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and the furniture and implements thereof, by this compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive name of Armies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note>For answer some say, That it may be that the Israelites were then in Camp and Garrison, when <hi>Moses</hi> wrote this, which estate of theirs being militarie, he useth a military word. Indeed if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the form of Heaven, the Prophet saith, <hi>It is as a Tent spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, Esay</hi> 40. 22. In regard of which, the furniture which is under it is fitly compared to Armies and Bands, or Troops, to inhabit it.</p>
               <p>But many other good and forcible reasons there are, why Heaven is called a Tent or Pavilion, and the furniture in it compared to Squadrons of Souldiers in a Camp.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>As first in regard of the huge multitude of things in them; for <pb n="118" facs="tcp:62585:86"/>one cannot say the furniture or implements of a house is compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them; therefore the furniture of an Host doth best expresse it.</p>
               <p>Every Creature therefore in Heaven or Earth is Gods Souldier, in pay with him, and hath received some weapons to punish Gods Enemies, and the several kindes are, as it were, the Ensignes of his Army, and the company of all are the Host and Army Royall.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>The second reason is in respect of order, because no Camp can be more orderly trained than the course of Nature in the order of Gods Creatures. The dayes in Winter cast themselves, as it were, in a ring, in the Summer abroad and so come long. The Starres keep duly their assigned place, time and course, without disorder or disturbance to the rest. So the Herbs doe in their order, and seasons one follow another. And so doe the Fish gather together in skuts and squadrons, and march about the Sea coasts in their kindes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, There is a respect beyond these, which is in regard of their head and Captain; for in an Host there must needs be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Leader or head Governour of all, which we cannot say of houshold-stuffe or apparel, for it implyeth not a head necessarily: Man, therefore, is made the Captain and guide or head of this Host, In which regard they are thus called.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Fourthly, There is a higher regard, which is of God the chief and supreme head or Emperor, in which respect God is called, <hi>The Lord of Hosts, Exod.</hi> 15. 3. Therefore, as man on Earth is Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to lead you; so in Heaven and Earth God is Chieftain and highest Commander of them; For if God send out his swift watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, all Creatures doe carefully obey and muster themselves to doe his will, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 15. If he doe but hisse or whistle, they come out and set forward, <hi>Esay</hi> 7.
18. And for retreat, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 39. if he say <hi>Peace, and be still, the windes cease, are still,</hi> and goe no further.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5.</note>Last of all, because if they had been expressed by the term of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel or furniture, it might have been thought that all things had been made for pleasure: but by the comparison of Soldiers, they are made known to be made for service also, as Soldiers are.</p>
               <p>All other kindes of service are but for one use, as a Servants ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is only obedience either to doe or not to doe, but there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble use and service of a Soldier:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Miles pro &amp; contra.</hi>
                  </note>The one is to apply himself to the good of his Captain and Country:The other to be
<hi>ad oppositum</hi> against his enemies, to defend his Captain, and to offend his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie. So mans life is called a Warfare, and Christians are Soldiers, in both virtues endeavoring to doe good and to resist evil, and to throw down all that doth oppose it self against God.</p>
               <p>Also wheresoever mention is made of an Army, there is implyed an Enemie, which therefore giveth some occasion out of this, to gather the fall of Angels, which Heavenly Creatures are made not only to serve <hi>ad muniendum, sed ad puniendum,</hi> for the benefit of the good, but for the punishment of disobedient and disloyal servants;<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62585:86"/>for against such, all things in Heaven and in Earth, doe arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for revenge, and oppose them selves against them.</p>
               <p>We may if you please muster these Armies in their several ranks and orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Armies in Heaven, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftiall Spirits, as the Angells.</note>And first concerning the Armies in Heaven, they are of two sorts.

                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:62585:88"/>For as it is a fault in working to labour and not to perfect, so it is a fault also not to leave off when the work is well and perfect, because by being over curious we make the work worse, is we marre it not altogether, and so make it imperfect again.</p>
               <p>Yet there are some of so curious minde, and withall of so restlesse a spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. as cannot be content with perfection it self, but will depart from the fellowship of the Church.</p>
               <p>They are such as <hi>Salomon</hi> speaketh of <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.
33. who will not be content when all is clean, but will still be blowing the nose untill the blood follow.</p>
               <p>These may be called fellows of the preterpluperfect tense, whom nothing can please, be it never so perfect, unlesse it feed their giddy and brain-sick humors.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Moses</hi> telleth us, that as God is not defective in his works, so he is not excessive, <hi>sed manum detorquet,</hi> when all was perfect he stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hand, gave over his work and betook himself to rest.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the dependance of this verse.</p>
               <p>Touching the parts, they are two in number.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>The other is his rest, when he had made an end.</p>
               <p>For the first we have to consider three things.
<note place="margin">1.</note>First, the action of finishing.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, the time in which he did finish.
<note place="margin">3.</note>And the third is touching the rest it self.</p>
               <p>Touching the first, There was a beginning when nothing was made; after he made all things, he commeth to an end, and there finisheth all. If he be <hi>Alpha, i.</hi> the beginning of a thing, he will be <hi>Omega,</hi> that is, bring it to a happie and perfect end, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 8.</p>

They imagine such a devise which they are not able to bring to passe, because their arme is too weak and short to doe it: Or if we have strength yet oftentimes the cost and charge is too great, which the work requireth. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 30. So <hi>some men take in hand to build houses, which,</hi> for lack of sufficient store, <hi>are not able to finish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Last of all, Man himself very often before he can finish and come to an end of his work, hath his dayes finished, and his years come to an end. Wherefore <hi>fear not what man can doe unto thee, seeing his breath is in his nostrills;</hi> for there are many wayes to prevent and alter or hinder their purpose, for God can take away his breath before he can bring it to passe. <hi>But God is not as man, he cannot repent or alter his minde, Numb.</hi> 23. 19.</p>
               <p>If God saith he will doe any thing, <hi>Quis impediet?</hi> he would know <hi>Who can let or hinder it? Esay</hi> 43. 13. Therefore this is our comfort which <hi>Moses</hi> saith <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 4. <hi>Omne opus Dei perfectum:</hi> And therfore <hi>if he hath begun any good work in us, he will throughly finish it in the end, Phil.</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:62585:89"/>1. 6. Wherefore let us also, when we have well begun, never give over any good thing untill we have finished it, and having well done one thing, we must not then and there leave off <hi>and start aside like a broken bow</hi> from doing any more,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 57. for God ceaseth not, he never giveth over <hi>dixit, fecit,</hi> untill the return came, <hi>&amp; fuit sic, &amp; perfecit.</hi> We must persevere then, the Philosophers said that <hi>Perseverantia est virtus virtutum.</hi> And <hi>Gregorie</hi> saith, Of all Virtues only Perseverance is crowned. The goodnesse and good works of the wicked are as shooting starres, falling and vanishing suddenly, and as a Land-flood or plash of water,
<hi>Ose</hi> 6. 4. which continue not, but are soon dried up: They are as a fire of thornes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. 12. Therefore let us not frame our selves to their manner of doing well.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Pharao</hi> ten times began well, but still declined from amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the faults, which he knew and confessed, <hi>Exod</hi> 8. 8. &amp;c. This is their behaviour. But the estate of the Godly, is the state and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> as <hi>St. Augustine</hi> saith, that is, be holy and clean all their dayes; for if they touch any unclean thing the last day, then all their dayes are reckoned unclean.</p>
               <p>Now as we draw this from Gods perfection; so for the time when he rested (namely the seventh day) we learn to avoid protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and delayes. For God doth not only end, but he endeth also in a short time, even within seven dayes; which is not the manner of men, who in good things are as a Snayle, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. 8. Seeing God then within seven dayes finished
<hi>omnia opera sua,</hi> his great works of Creation, what a shame it is that we cannot finish our <hi>opuscula,</hi> a few small good things in many yeers.</p>
               <p>Now we are come to <hi>opus suum quod fecerat,</hi> of which I will only shew you some notes, which <hi>St. Augustine</hi> hath gathered out of it.</p>
               <p>First, saith he, We may see that all that which was created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, so infinite Hosts of Creatures in number, and so diverse in kinde on every side and part of the World, all that innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plurality is here by God in one rolled up, and is called <hi>opus suum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though Heaven and Earth be so farre asunder, and so contrarie in nature, yet here they are brought to an unity and attonement; the means whereof, as he saith, is man, who being both of Heaven and Earth, became
<hi>vinculum perfectionis,</hi> joyning both together in Man, as they both together were for man, and under his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Now in that he saith <hi>Opus suum quod fecerat, Agustine</hi> noteth it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are some men which doe brag of <hi>opus suum,</hi> but they cannot boast of <hi>quod fecerant,</hi> because there are some which doe not only build upon another mans foundation (which <hi>St. Paul</hi> would not doe) but also upon another mans Timber and Stones too, as one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten <hi>St. Pauls</hi> Parchments or Epistles, should say and set them out as his own, but these cannot say, as God here doth <hi>opus suum quod fecerat.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>Now touching the third point, I ask first, <hi>Whether God was weary of working because he rested?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note>To which the School-men answer, That, rest is here not opposed to wearinesse but to work, for he could not be weary of his work; because all that he did was done without labour, for he made all, by saying only <hi>let it be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But happily a man, with long and much speaking may be weary: But we see that God spake but even one word, at least few, and short words, and therefore could not be weary so: Also a man is not weary of that which he doth, with faculty, and facility too: But God doth all things not only with faculty, but with the greatest facility that may be, for nothing is hard to him, or beyond the compasse of his power; therefore we cut off all wearinesse from God, and say, That his rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was only a ceasing, or leaving off to make any more new things, for his rest is only <hi>negatio operis, non affirmatio laboris.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>The other question is, <hi>Doth God then cease and rest from all manner of work; hath he ever since done nothing more?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note>That is impossible, for seeing he is <hi>Actum primum;</hi> therefore he cannot be idle, and rest from all things, as we may imagine; as he bath <hi>quietem activam,</hi> so hath he
<hi>motum stabilem,</hi> a quiet motion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any labor; and this we may learn out of <hi>Moses</hi> words, for he saith not simply, that then God rested, but he rested from his works, and not absolutely from every work, but only from the works which he had created, that is,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A novis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendis, sed non a veteribus conservandis.</hi>
                  </note>from creating any more things, from the works of creation he rested <hi>a novis condendis, sed non a veteribus conservan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis;</hi> for this was the Sabbath dayes work, which then he began: So saith Christ, <hi>pater meus adhuc operatur, &amp; ego operor, John</hi> 5.

We say, in the Schools, that there is a double cause of things, the one is <hi>causa sieri</hi> the other is <hi>causa esse.</hi> The first, is the cause of making: As a Carpenter having made a house perfect, forsaketh it and careth no more for it, till it fall down or as the fire is of heat, or as the clock keeper, is of the going of the clock, who when he hath set it to his minde, leaveth it untill the plumets fall down:
<hi>causa esse,</hi> is as the candle is of light, which being taken away, the light is gone: So is God the cause of our life, being as a candle, whose being is of light: And in that respect <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Lift up the light of thy countenance,</hi> as if God were our candle, who being taken away, our life and light is clean put out, and become dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 29.
<hi>If he take away his breath from us, we dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We say then, that he rested not from preserving and governing, though he did rest from making.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hermes,</hi> by the light of reason, could say, That it were very absurd to think that God should leave and neglect the things he had made; and God imputeth it as a fault to the Ostrich, <hi>Job</hi> 39. 18, 19 to leave her eggs without care and regard in the sands, therefore God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self will be free of that blame and blemish which he condemneth in others. As we say of the Father, so we say of the Sonne, which is<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62585:90"/>the word of God,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 9. <hi>He commanded and they were made,</hi> there is creation, <hi>He said the word and they stood fast:</hi> which is the second work of preservation and guiding. Also <hi>Psal.</hi> 148. 5, 6. He first made them with his word which is the first work of creation, long sithence ended, and he gave them a Law, which they should not break, which is the other work of establishing and governing things made: So <hi>Coll.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of Christ saith, <hi>By him all things have their being</hi> or existence: and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>By him all things have their supportance,</hi> and are held up.</p>
               <p>He resteth not also from the ruling and governing of the World.
<hi>A Sparrow is one of the basest and meanest Birds, Matth.</hi> 10. 29, 30. Yet their motion is directed by his providence and will, yea <hi>the hairs of our head</hi> (<hi>are numbred,</hi>) and none of them fall without his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: how much more then is he provident in disposing and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mans motions?</p>
               <p>He hath a stroke in all that we doe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 1.
<hi>The answer of our tongue is guided by God,</hi> and in the 9. verse, the direction of our wayes, and the end and issue of their purposes and thoughts; yea he ordereth and governeth our hands and feet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 10.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 56. 13. He I say, fashioneth all our thoughts, and knoweth them long before; so that we have no power in our heart to think, in the tongue to speak, or hand to doe ought, but as we are directed by God; yea for things most casuall as Lots and Chances which are attributed to fortune, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.
33. Even that is ruled by the Lord God, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>The Lot of Matthias and Joseph called Barsabas is cast into the Lap, but the Lord doth dispose it and causeth it to fall unto Matthias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That also which we call Chance-medley, as when many men walking in the street; one of them is killed with a stone falling on him, of such a chance God saith, <hi>Ego Dominus extuli illum hominem, Exod.</hi> 21. 13. So that God hath his stroke even in ordering such things? If this be so, then let us not say as they did, <hi>Job.</hi> 22. 13. Tush, God walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth above and regardeth not the things on earth, or with them, God seeth us not; For he both seeth, governeth, and preserveth all on earth: For though the Lord be in heaven, yet he humbleth himself to look down and behold the sonnes of men, and considereth that there is none of them good, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 2. And God hath not only, <hi>Librum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum creatarum, Psal.</hi> 139. 16. But he hath a register <hi>verborum &amp; factorum,</hi> of words and deeds also,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 3 16. And that we may know not our being only, but our preserving and guiding, is of the Lord and his work: he will at the last bring all these things to Judgment, <hi>Preach.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
               <p>As for Gods rest after <hi>That he had made all things for himself, Prov.</hi> 16. 4. Then did he <hi>introire in regnum suum, Heb.</hi>
4. 10. So that he went out of his rest for our sakes, and having made all for us; he is said not to rest in his work, nor after his work, but from his work, for he had no need of these things, for he had most perfect rest in his own glory, <hi>which he had before the World was made, John</hi> 17. 5. into that rest then he now returned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:62585:90"/>Secondly, we see that in Gods rest his works goe before it; for the word is not <hi>quievit</hi> but
<hi>requievit,</hi> which sheweth that if we be first imployed about the works of God and then rest; it may well be called Gods rest, but that rest which is without work is <hi>Issachars</hi> rest, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 15. that is, idlenesse, and such as give themselves to that, are called <hi>Cretians,</hi> idle and slow bellies, as <hi>St. Paul</hi> calleth them, and those shall never enter into Gods rest, for it is <hi>pigra vocatio</hi> and not a return to rest.</p>
               <p>If God had his work six dayes before he rested in creation, and if <hi>Adam</hi> had his work in the state of innocency, then it is much more meet now, That <hi>man should goe forth to his labor untill the evening, Psal.</hi> 104. 23. They which are not <hi>in labore hominum, Psal.</hi> 73. But lye on their beds imagining mischief, <hi>Pro.</hi> 26. 14. They shall not rest in the Lord, because God made them for good works to walk in them,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>There are a number of superfluous Creatures, as one calleth the idle ones, of whom if we should demand, What is thy calling or work? They cannot say, we are exercised in the works of men; neither doe they work in the will of God: therefore if they doe any thing, they busie themselves in meddling about other mens matters.</p>
               <p>It is strange to see how busie we are in taking in hand evill things, and how earnest we are in doing them, and how constant in not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them over, or ceasing from such works, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Judas,</hi> can watch all night, to work his treason; but <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest could not watch, one hour, to pray with Christ, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. 37. &amp;c.
<hi>Non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus, tantum perseverantiae in bono, quantum constantiae in malo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Husbandmen in their works for earthly things are earnest, they follow his counsell, <hi>Preach.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Not to cease sowing from the morning untill the evening,</hi> but will make an end; but in the works of God, we cannot follow his counsell, 9. 9. to doe all that thou takest in hand with all thy power and strength, <hi>quicquid agis instanter age,</hi> saith one, after the example of <hi>Abrahams</hi> servant; <hi>who would not eat nor rest untill he had done his Masters work, Gen.</hi> 24. 33. And as <hi>David</hi> who vowed, <hi>That he would not suffer his eyes to slumber, nor his eye-lids to take any rest, untill he had found out a place for Gods Arke, Psal.</hi>
132. 2, 3. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between work and rest.</note>Now we are come to the last point, which is the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween work and rest; which is as great odds as six to one, for he wrought six dayes and rested the seventh. This then if we apply will sit somewhat neer us: for though happyly we doe some work at some times, and perhaps doe perfect it at last. Yet this is the manner of the world when they are weary of idlenesse, or can doe no other worldly thing, then it cometh into their mindes to say
<hi>operemur opera Dei,</hi> and when we take it in hand, we work not six dayes as God did, and rest one; but we rest six daves and labor one: we should use rest as a sauce, and labor as our meat, <hi>Job.</hi> 4. 34. And we know there is great odds and difference between the dishes, in which they are served; but it is our fashion to use labor as a sauce, to get us a stomack to rest.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62585:91"/>But we must not be as <hi>Jobs</hi> Sonnes and Daughters,
<hi>Job</hi> 1. 4. that is, to spend whole dayes yea many dayes in delights and jollity, and few hours in the works of our vocation: for this is not to rest after Gods example.</p>
               <p>The last use which we are to make of this, is that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle gathereth out of the <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 10. As God did rest from his works, so let us from ours: we must esteem <hi>our righteousnesses and best works as filthy rags, Esay</hi> 64. 6. Yea as very dung, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. And say as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 28. <hi>Verebar opera mea:</hi> thus we must rest from our own works, because there is no safety or quietnesse in them, but leave our own righteousnesse, that we may rest in Christ and in the works he hath wrought for us.</p>
               <p>And great reason it is, that we should only and wholly rest in him, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 28. <hi>Quoniam in ipso movemur,</hi> therefore
<hi>requiescamus in illo,</hi> if he be Lord of hoasts, that is, of all works; then let him be to us the Lord of Sabbath also, both are noted in this preposition (<hi>in</hi>) for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our work and labor in this life is <hi>in Deum,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10.

<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 10. We are of him, that is, for creation: we are by him, that is, for preservation: and we are in him, that is, our end and finall rest in him: To whom be all honor, praise, power, and dominion for ever.</p>

               <p>God doth not rather extoll the seventh day, than the other six dayes, as if he did more favor and like idlenesse, then labor and work, for this is truly affirmed, both of God and godly men (of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,) which that heathen man said of himself, <hi>Nunquam minus otiosus quam cum otiosus fui:</hi> for as one saith, <hi>Circumcisio cordis durior labore corporis,</hi> wherefore by this God only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>
                  <hi>But why did God passe over the six dayes and appropriate this speciall exaltation to the seventh day only?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note>Surely it was to teach us to passe by all the creatures which God had made, and all that might be attained unto, by bodily labor and work: and not to seek for blessednesse in the six dayes work; but only in the blessing of the seventh day, given by his word which is above and beyond all that is in the Creatures.</p>
               <p>But the other reason is more sensible, which is, because every one of the six dayes, brought his reall blessing with it. Of which
<hi>Jobs</hi> wife had skill, <hi>Benedictus Deus in donis suis, Job</hi> 3. 9. Which is <hi>Oses</hi> blessednesse, <hi>Benedictus dominus quo ditati sumus,</hi> But the world hath no feeling of <hi>St. Pauls</hi> blessings, which are spirituall, who saith blessed <hi>be God which made us rich in all spirituall riches in Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore that we may know, that we have more cause to,
<hi>blesse</hi> God, for his spirituall blessings given unto us on the Sabbath day by his word, then for his temporall blessings which we receive at other times by his Creatures, therefore did he specially blesse this seventh day: for God knoweth we are easily brought to say, blessed be God, and blessed be this day in which we receive temporall blessings, and that place we will call
<hi>the valley of blessing,</hi> 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 20. 26. And on the other side, we think that day a cursed day, as <hi>Job</hi> did, in which we receive evills, <hi>Job</hi> 3. 8. But seeing all true and eternall blessings doe follow and shine, from the blessing of this day: it is indeed to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed a blessed day.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>But I will ask, <hi>Whether the other dayes were not also blessed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note>Yes every one of them as we may see, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> had his <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixit,</hi> which though they were temporall, yet they have a very good Analogy, and fit proportion, with the spirituall blessings of this day, of<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62585:92"/>this day; for as we have a natural good use of the goodnesse of the Creatures on the six dayes, by their blessings given them; So here on the Sabath we have a spiritual use of the Creatures: For as the temporal and corporal use of the six dayes is
<hi>ad cultum corporis,</hi> so this spiritual use of the seventh day is <hi>ad cultum animae,</hi> that so having blessings provided both for body and soul, we may by both kindes of blessings come unto God, <hi>in whose presence is the fullnesse of joy and blessednesse for ever, Psal.</hi> 70. 4.</p>
               <p>Touching the blessing of the Sabath, We say that thing is blessed of God, to which God vouchsafeth some peculiar or special favour. So
<hi>Isaac</hi> is called <hi>Benedictus Domini, Gen.</hi> 26. 12. because God shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him such special favours. It was the strife between <hi>Esau</hi> and
<hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> because of the blessing, that is, the superiority,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 37.
<note place="margin">What maketh the Sabath the chief day in the week.</note>Therefore this day having the special blessing, is by it made the head and chief day of the week.</p>
               <p>The honor which is given to this day is holinesse, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by sanctifying or hallowing, which consisteth in two things.</p>
               <p>The first is <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 26. which is separation or setting it apart from common and prophane uses, to the which they were or might be applyed before, before which they were called things common and prophane. So was this day first a common and an ordinary day, like to all the other ordinary dayes: yea, it might be thought to us before a waste emptie day, bringing no good with it to us; but now being set apart, the day which the builders would refuse, by this, is made the head and chief day of building; for as a man being set a a part to be a Magistrate, is thereby made above ordinarie men; so is this day now among other dayes, being set a part by Gods word.</p>
               <p>As the separation of it from prophane uses is the first part; so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently ensueth for the sanctifying of any thing the appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to Gods holy uses, to the which he hath appointed it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 28. as the sanctified Instruments of the Temple must not serve to any other uses, but to that holy use and purpose in the Temple, for which they were made. If we then so use this day and separate it from prophane things, to holy exercises, it will be a blessed day to us; for Gods blessing given to this day is a real blessing, and will cause us to grow in holinesse here, and by it to blessedness in the life to come: For this must needs be granted, that he which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it blessed it for some body; if for some body, then for himself, or for some other; but he made it not for himself, for he is <hi>God for ever and ever blessed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as <hi>St. Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Omnia munda mundis, Titus,</hi> 1. 15. so we may say, <hi>Omnia sunt sancta sanctis;</hi> and therefore all things being holy to him which is holiest of all, it is sure that he sanctified it not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>Then it followeth, that it must needs be either for Man or for some other Creature; but not for any other Creature, because they themselves were all blessed and sanctified for us and our sakes, so<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62585:92"/>saith Christ, <hi>Sabatum erat propter hominem, non homo propter

               </p>
               <p>Now we come to the counsell of God in the institution of the Sabath, the Psalmist saith 111. 2, 3, 4. <hi>That the works of God are great, and to be sought out of all them which have pleasure in them:</hi> And again
<hi>That God hath so wrought his marvellous works that they ought to be had in remembrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is Gods will and counsel therefore in these works, first that we should have a remembrance of them, and not to forget his benefits in them; for he made them that we should not only have a corporal use of them, but a spiritual use also, as <hi>David</hi> had, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. 5.
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitavi,</hi> or, <hi>recordatus sum omnia opera tua,</hi> that is, it should be our delight and pleasure to call to minde again and again his bounty and magnificence in his works, that blessing him for these benefits, we may be blessed of him for ever in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Thus we see the dependence of this work and the counsel of God therein, to the end that this counsell of God may prosper and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed well, that we may have fit occasion to call to minde his works, to blesse him for it, and to be blessed of him: It was requisite and necessarie that God should take order to appoint a time, in which (setting aside all other worldly duties of our calling, we should only and wholly, as much as our weak nature can suffer) apply our selves to this Christian duty of meditation and serving God, which here is set down to be the seventh day, in which circumstance of time we have four things to consider.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>First, That some day or time must be appointed to that end.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, That it should be a day or time certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, That the certain time should be in a certain number of dayes, which the Fathers call <hi>taxatio temporis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Fourthly, That it should be the seventh day, which is <hi>taxatio diet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>For the first we see, That reason consenteth to that which <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> saith, <hi>Preach.</hi> 8. 6.
<hi>That there is an appointed time for every action under the Sunne,</hi> but especially <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it be a matter of weight and serious businesse indeed. Then reason wills that we should make speciall choyce of a time, when secluding all other things, we may intend only and wholly to it alone.</p>
               <p>For if we should not have a certain time appointed to us, we of our selves are so carelesse, that we would make accompt of very few dayes or none at all, to sanctifie unto the Lords worship.</p>
               <p>This matter then of Gods worship and Religion, being a matter of our soul, is the most weighty and serious businesse that can be, in as much as the soul is the worthiest part of us: And therefore it concerneth the freehold of our souls so neerly, that if we neglect or set light by it, <hi>Agitur de anima,</hi> our soul is in jeopardy: But if we set light of our soul (which being so precious a thing, is worth looking to) yet in another regard it is a weighty duty, and therefore we ought to be carefull of it, because God is worthy of this service and duty, which is <hi>opus Sabati,</hi> wherefore indeed there is no time of our life, but that we should think chiefly of this as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:62585:93"/>held, That a man ought perpetually to be present and conversant with God, And in our words send up short prayers and praises to God. And that this is a bounden duty, daily to be performed, it is agreeable to the word of God,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 28. which was shewed in their daily sacrifice every morning and evening, offering oblations and incense to God.</p>
               <p>But who is it that is able all the dayes of his life, night and day, to intend his businesse as he ought; for this belonged as a duty, not only unto the Jews, but unto every Christian now.</p>
               <p>Seeing this one businesse is to be intended above all other, and every thing is then best ordered, when we appropriate and apply the time and our studies only and wholly to it, as the proverb is, <hi>Quod unice, id unum, quod solicite id solum agas,</hi> for this is the wisdome of man in matters of this life: Then we must needs hearken to the counsell of the Prophet,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 46. 10. <hi>Desistite, be still,</hi> or leave off other things,
<hi>that ye may know I am the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And to the advise of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5. we may leave off other matters, and must consent <hi>so to doe for a time, that the more fully and wholly we may be given to prayer and fasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is called of some <hi>Induciae seculo,</hi> a truce taken with the world for a time, that not being troubled with the affairs thereof, we may only set before us (as much as our weak natures can) our duty in the service of God, which is our sanctification. Therefore God appointed to this spiritual work a time at large, that is, appointed some time, in which only and wholy <hi>Adam</hi> by necessity was enjoyed to this work. Wherefore; by all conveyance of reason, by a much greater necessity, must we know, that we also must have a time at large for this businesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>The second point is, That it was necessary, not only that there should be a time at large, that is, some time of our dayes, but also a certain set time or day appointed for it, for otherwise God should have slender service, or scarce any at all; for if it were left at our liberty, we would take liberty to serve him when we list, and when we could intend it, and when we had nothing else to doe: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one said well, according to <hi>St. Peter, Christiana libert as pallium est pessimis moribus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I referre me to your judgement how well God will be served if there were no time certainly appointed, seeing this which is set down is so ill kept: Those therefore which urge Christian liberty and would not have a set certain day, but every day a Sabath, they would have God stand at that portion of time and service, which mens devotion and liberality would afford.</p>
               <p>This then would be the inconvenience of uncertainty in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <hi>perpetuum Sabatum &amp; jejunium</hi> would prove none at all: And therefore God saw it necessary that we must have a set and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time.</p>
               <p>And in this the Law of Nature agreeth with the Law of God; for the Heathen had their <hi>statae feriae,</hi> set and appointed holy dayes: and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62585:93"/>the Hebrews call their holy-dayes by the name of
<hi>Mogne,</hi> which is a staid certain time, still unmovable, not at random, but set down and appointed firm and perpetual.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Now we are come to the third point, That it must be one of the seven in the week, which came not by natures light, but by Gods ordinance, his word setting it down, therefore was it told
<hi>Adam, that he should tell it to the Posterities to come:</hi> By which means the Gentills came to the knowledge of it, and held it by tradition; for in their books we shall plainly see it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucianus</hi> testifieth, that as the Jews kept their holy-day (in which they worship God) on the Saturday: the Turks on the Friday: the Egyptians on the Thursday: the Assyrians on the Wednesday: the Persians on the Tuesday: The Grecians on the Monday: And Christians now doe keep their day of worship the Sunday and first day of the week; So that in all quarters and parts of the Earth every day and part of time is kept as a set day of divine worship. And for the seventh day, we shall see that the Pythagoreans had received a glimmering of this knowledge, for they called the number of 7
<hi>numerum quietis,</hi> and the number hallowed of God, and the divine number, or Gods number, which they had (no doubt) not by the light of Nature and reason, but by tradition from their Elders, and so delivered it to their Posterity.</p>
               <p>It is strange which <hi>Eusebius</hi> recordeth out of two Heathenish Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, 13. <hi>de preparatione Evangelii,</hi> The one of
<hi>Linus</hi> verse 2. That God made and finished all things the seventh day: the other of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siod</hi> (we agreeing to that) saith, that therefore the seventh day is the Lords holy-day. And on the seventh day therefore the Gentiles called on their Gods, and had their meetings in it, and called the number of 7 <hi>Minerva,</hi> by the name of their God. <hi>Macrobius</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that the Gentiles did mean by <hi>Pan</hi> and <hi>Jano</hi> and all other names of Gods, only the great God <hi>Apollo,</hi> as their chief God whom they served the seventh day.</p>
               <p>But this is our rule most plainly revealed from Gods word, that it is his will, that we should keep the seventh day holy; for seeing all the dayes are his, he should have done no injurie, if he had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and dedicated all the dayes of the week to be spent and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his service, yet he hath not done so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Augustine</hi> saith, That if God had given us but one day of the seven to work in, for our own commodity, it had been more than he had owed us, it had not been given of duty, but of his lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesse and liberality.</p>
               <p>But now seeing he hath not given us one, or two, or every other day for our businesse, but the whole six, and reserved but one of the seven for himself to be served in; this is so equall, that none can complain or think to be hardly dealt withall.</p>
               <p>If any man shall now be so sacrilegious, having six dayes given him freely, as to take from him that hath but one reserved to himself, it is intollerable injury, and not to be excused, and as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:62585:94"/>saith, 2 <hi>Samuell</hi> 12. 5. he may well be called the Child of death.</p>
               <p>The fourth and last point is <hi>taxatio diei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the World had the knowledge of the former three points, so this point standeth upon very good and sufficient reason; for seeing that the day is or deined in remembrance of this work and benefit of Creation (for that is the end why the Turks and Jews did celebrate holy-dayes, in them, to remember some notable work and benefit) therefore it is reason that God should make choise of such a day, in which the benefit might be best remembred: And of all the dayes in the week we shall see the seventh day to be the fittest to retain and keep in memory the commendation of this benefit and work of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. When God had performed this great work of Creation, he took order also, because it was the greatest benefit which as yet the World had or knew of, that the seventh day should be alwaies had in remembrance, because he had fully perfected all the work in it; and the very same reason which made the Jews Sabath on the seventh day, doth now also move Christians to keep it on the first day in the week, for it is Gods will that the lesser benefit should surcease and give place to the greater, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 7. and that the benefit of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the lesser, should yeeld and give place to the work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, which is the greater benefit.</p>
               <p>When Christ cometh, we shall not then extoll and magnifie the deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but that shall cease and not be counted the greatest benefit; But we shall talk of Christs work and deliverance from Hell and Satan: So the day of Creation must give place to the day of Redemption.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Apostles, after Christs Ascention, changed the seventh day unto the first day of the week, which we shall see, is most fit to keep in memory this greatest work and benefit of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as
<hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi> doe hold and prove: Because if (B) were the Dominical letter when Christ was borne, his Nativity was on the first day of the week, his Resurrection, Apparition of the Holy-Ghost, and Ascention, was also on the first day in the week. And also the first day is most fit to retain in minde the restauration of the World: So it is not unmeet to remember the Creation, which was begun the first day. And besides all this, it may serve as the fittest time to cause us to remember the benefit of glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for seeing <hi>our Inheritance is in light, Coll.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>And God made light,</hi> the first day, <hi>to come out of darknesse,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4. 6. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 3. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is most fit to put us in minde of that also.</p>
               <p>We will beginne the next time where we now leave.</p>
               <p>And you remember the last time according to the division we then made, we spake somewhat of the institution and observation or use of the Sabath. The former being implyed in the word (<hi>blessing</hi>) the other in the word (<hi>sanctifying:</hi>) Touching which we say with the ancient Fathers, that <hi>quodlibet officium Dei est beneficium nostrum.</hi> Therefore
<hi>Adam,</hi> having received so many benefits of God, was<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62585:94"/>bound by necessarie duty, to performe some service to God for them, which every day in part he should have done as duty required; But some one day he ought wholly to apply all the powers of his minde, and all the parts and members of his body about it alone.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we have shewed,
<note place="margin">1.</note>first, That there must be some one day or time set a part to the solemne intending of the work and worship of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, That it ought to be some certain day.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, That God, measuring out his
<hi>vectigal temporis,</hi> the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of time due to him, did assigne it to be once in seven dayes, which revolution of seven hath a special use both in things natural and in things spiritual; for in Religion, as in seven dayes is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, so in the feast of the seventh moneth is the feast of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, or the feast of weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>The last point is a positive day and time, namely, the seventh day, which God chose as most fit for his work.</p>
               <p>Touching which the Jews themselves did not so much stand, in the strict limitation of the set day: For they held, That if a man by sleep or
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, knew nor certainly which was the seventh day, it was not a matter absolutely necessary, so that he kept one day of the seven. To this end therefore of worshipping God, he would have us make a truce with the World. And as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, we must have a vacation from the works of our Vocation. And as Christ would have us,
<hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42. we must lay aside <hi>Martha's</hi> part, that not being troubled with many things, we might attend to <hi>Mary's</hi> part: The better for separating our selves from worldly things, and dedicating our selves to heavenly things, is the ground of this institution,

                  </note>But the Sabath of

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>The second is Theicall or Ceremoniall, which Ceremonies are excellently well divided thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1. Some clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures or fences.</note>Some were appointed as closures or fences, to inclose and defend or aid the Law,
<note place="margin">Ceremonies of <hi>Sinay.</hi>
                  </note>as the sixth Precept had this Ceremonie for his fence, <hi>That men should eat no blood, to signifie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> them how greatly they should abhor murder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Rudiments to the Gospell.</note>The other Types or Ceremonies were rudiments and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons leading us darkly, as by Riddles and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to some necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry points of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>So the Ceremonie of the Saboth taught us a double Lesson and Document, the one of a benefit already past and exhibited, as of the Creation done on the seventh day. The other of a benefit to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited hereafter and perfected also on the seventh day, that is, the work of Redemption and Regeneration. So now the promised Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour being come, that Ceremony of the set seventh day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the first day in the week is in its stead. There was also another Ceremonie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.
9. and that taught us to rest from finne in this<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62585:95"/>life, and also it was a type of the eternall rest in the life to come, <hi>Revel.</hi>
14. 13.</p>
               <p>The third end was peculiar to the Jews for that special work and benefit of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt, Deut.</hi> 5. 15. wherefore the Jews say, that they have a double right and interest in the Sabath.</p>
               <p>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 19. 8. so to esteeme of things as they were in the primitive state in their first institution, <hi>a principio non fuit sic:</hi> Wherefore when we say there was a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie in this Law, and a Riddle, it must be understood, that it was not so from the beginning in Paradise, but was after added as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory to it, and the reason inevitable to prove it, is set down, <hi>Coll.</hi> 2. 17. where Christ is said to be the body and substance of all sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>Wherefore seeing there could be no shadow where was no body, we conclude, that at this institution there could be no Ceremonie, for where and when no sinne and losse is, there needed then no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. But there was no sinne nor losse to man, untill after this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was instituted, as appeareth in the next Chapter, wherefore now it hath no such ceremonial end; for the only chief end now was to <hi>Adam,</hi> because he having but a finite soul, could not attend two things at once but <hi>diviso corde,</hi> wherefore, that he might attend this <hi>toto corde,</hi> this was ordained. And this was the principall end which was before the Ceremony, and remaineth still to us after the Ceremonie.</p>
               <p>Touching the other Ceremonie, which was a fence to the Law, it is set down <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 2. which also was accessory: for only we reckon that to be Ceremonial in the fourth Commandement, which afterwards was added to the first end, and was ended in Christ; and thus we stop the mouths of Papists, which say, Seeing the fourth Precept is ceremonial, why is not the second also? and of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists who reason even so against the third precept touching Oaths, saying, Why should not it be ceremonial as well as that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these Ceremonies only were added for a time <hi>ad erudiendum intellectum, &amp; ad informandos mores:</hi> Wherefore the first end remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; So that as the Eve of the Sabath is <hi>Nundinum ventris,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for provision for the belly, so the Sabath it self <hi>Nundinum mentis,</hi> the Faire to provide meat for our soul. And the Jews give a good reason why they were forbidden to goe forth to gather <hi>Manna</hi> on the Sabath day: For why should they be troubled with corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Manna,</hi> which was subject to putrifaction and rottennesse, seeing that day they were to gather the Heavenly
<hi>Manna</hi> which perished not.</p>
               <p>There remaineth one point touching our positive day of keeping the Sabath, why it is changed into the first day of the week. The reason is because the benefit we received by Christ the first day of the week, is greater then the former of Creation, here finished on the<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62585:95"/>seventh day: For by Christs work we are not only postored to our first estate of Gods Image, in which we were made; but also by it we are made partakers of the divine nature, as the Apostle saith; Therefore the former benefit of the day of Creation giveth place to this of the Redemption: For seeing his Resurrection was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the work, which was upon the first day of the week. Therefore the Disciples used to meet in their Assembles ever after upon the first day, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7. and called it <hi>the Lords day, Rev.</hi> 1.
10. And some of the Fathers doe think (considering well the 22, 23. verses of
118. <hi>Psalme</hi>) that it is a plain prediction of the change of the Sabath day, for the Prophet saith, <hi>That when the stone which the builders refused became the head corner stone, which was so wonderfull in our eyes</hi> (which was sulfilled at his Resurrection, for before he was the foundation stone) then it should be said, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, let us rejoyce and be glad in it,</hi> and give sacrifice and praise to God.</p>
               <p>Being therefore changable by the institution, we are not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our selves about the altering of the set day; but we will a little more return to the consideration of the commandement as it is morall.</p>
               <p>The fourth Commandement, in the 5. of <hi>Deut.</hi> beginneth with a <hi>Memento,</hi> which is a calling to minde of all his benefits; and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a sanctification to it, God sheweth <hi>quod in majori cultu colemus,</hi> and, as another doth interpret, <hi>sanctificavit,</hi> saying,
<hi>Intimavit Deus</hi> Adamo, <hi>quod diem illum sibi consecrâsset.</hi> And though we finde in the Commandement the word
<hi>benedixit</hi> attributed to God only as his proper action, yet
<hi>sanctificavit</hi> is applyed also to man, for which we have this rule, that when such words are given both to God and Man, it is to be understood, that it is affirmed of God <hi>sub modo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinandi,</hi> and to Man <hi>sub modo applicandi;</hi> God sanctified it when he made this day (which seemed to mans reason the meanest day) to be his day and the chiefest of dayes ordained and appointed to a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use and end, and our sanctifying of it is when we shall with care apply and spend it to that holy end.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>But now the question is,
<hi>Whether the Sabath and seventh day were by</hi> Adam <hi>and his posterity, after this institution to that end?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note>The Jews make no question of it, and also the old and new Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters affirm it. And they ground themselves upon two reasons. First, That otherwise God after the institution should be said to suspend and deferre the observation and practise of it untill the time of the Law, which is like to that foolish opinion of some touching the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which say that God created the matter of all things from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but put the work in execution at this certain time: But as the Fathers answer to that, so we say to this, <hi>Tum sanctificavit Sabatum cum vellet sanctum observari,</hi> not before he would have it put to the holy use.</p>
               <p>The second reason is <hi>Memento,</hi> which is set at the beginning of the commandement, which is, say they, <hi>quasi dicat,</hi> remember that thou<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62585:96"/>keep it as it hath been observed before; for (say they) it was but now renewed, for it was well known and kept before, therefore they thus expound it, <hi>Memento Legem hanc, Legeipsa Antiquiorem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whether it were observed according to the institution in the time of nature, before the Law that is not material, nor the point we stand upon. If they say, <hi>Quis unquam legit Abraham Sabatum ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servâsse?</hi> we may say likewise, <hi>Quis legit Adamum aut Abraham je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junâsse?</hi> yet they will not deny, but there is now use of fasting, and so is there of the Sabath.</p>
               <p>We must know <hi>St. Pauls</hi> rule to be true, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 8. <hi>that as bodily labour profiteth not, but godlinesse;</hi> so bodily rest availeth not, but as it is a help to sanctific us, and a furtherance to true holinesse; for if it be a hindrance to piety, or a cause to make us lesse holy, rest is evill, and farre worse than work and honest labour: Wherefore they which spend the Sabath day, not in the publique Congregation, but privatly at home in their houses and chambers doe ill, and were condemned by that ancient Conncell of <hi>Gangren,</hi> which was holden in <hi>France.</hi> And we read in 44. of <hi>Ezecbiel</hi> 19. that there were Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to look that the Sabath day should be well kept; it must much lesse then be made a Sabath of belly cheer, spent in no other then such as whereof commeth nothing but dung, being the only fruit of their festivall and holy-dayes; and God so hated it, that he cast it in their faces that so kept it, neither must it be spent in wanton recreation and lascivious pastime.</p>
               <p>Nor yet as the men of <hi>Ashedod</hi> did, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.
15. by making it a Market day and Faire to sell their Merchandises; for this is to make our purse and our belly, <hi>Mammon</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> our Gods, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate a holy-day to them: Nor as <hi>Shiloh</hi> did to dancing. Nor as our L. in frequenting Theaters and Playes, Bear and Bull baiting, for this is to turne away our foot from the Sabath, and from doing Gods will on the holy-day: We must not doe so, <hi>but we must call the Sabath a delight, to consecrate it to the Lord, and honor it, not doing our own wayes, nor seeking our own will, nor speaking a vain word, I say</hi> 28. 13. <hi>but we must,</hi> I say, <hi>delight in the Lord upon that day, and then his blessings of all sorts shall light upon us, verse</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>But let us come now to speak of these two things apart, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth our sanctification and observation of the Sabath to see what we should not doe, and then what we should doe as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us.</p>
               <p>Touching the rest from things inhibited, it is somewhat dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to speak of it, because our nature is given to such extremes; for there are two ancient Councels which doe bewray our corrupt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition. The one is <hi>Concilium Aurelianense</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that in those dayes the People were so straight laced, that they were perswaded, that it was utterly unlawfull to doe any thing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adjutorem</hi> or

18.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, namely, that it was self borne, and made it self, or was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and came of it self, as a thing casuall and by chance; which foolish and grosse opinion of Epicures was ever (for the absurdity thereof) hissed out of Schools: but <hi>Moses</hi> meeteth with this also, saying, <hi>that the Lord made it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And because it may be thought that there was divers Gods, he telleth us by a name which was never heard of before this time, by the which he describeth him unto us, and that is <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus he hath recapitulated all the former Chapter unto these three considerations, which is all one with the first use of the first Chapter, saving that here is expressed the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is not there; for this name of God is the most glorious name, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 58. and therefore <hi>Moses</hi> here reserveth it till every thing in this glorious World be fully accomplished and perfected. In the 6. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. it is said, he was not known by this name before then, that is, whilest he was bringing any thing to passe, and not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62585:99"/>he is
<hi>Elohim;</hi> but when he hath fully performed it and set it on foot, then he is known to be <hi>Jehovah,</hi> by whom the thing hath his being and is that which it is, for he is the essence and being of things that are.</p>
                  <p>There are many difficult mysteries in these names, which because some are too curious in standing upon, and others have itching eares listening too much after curiosities, I will omit; only this we must needs know, which the nature of the word sheweth, that God is he which is of himself, and by whom all things are, move, and have their being; for seeing we know not, nor can see the nature of God, we must give him a name according to the greatest benefits which we receive, and the greatest works which we have seen. But the work and benefit which is most common to all things, is (<hi>being:</hi>) Therefore by that name he is most fitly called; for life, moving, and reason all things have not, but every Creature hath his benefit of
<hi>being:</hi> and therefore he taketh his name from this general benefit which is seen in all.</p>
                  <p>Another reason of this name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is taken from the perfection of this <hi>being Exod.</hi> 3. 14. which is set down
<hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 4. because he was, is, and shall be for ever.</p>
                  <p>Therefore no Creature but God, can ever say <hi>I am,</hi> this is my name; for if a Creature of the time that is past should say,
<hi>Before Abraham was I am, John</hi> 8. 58. he should make himself God.</p>
                  <p>So if a Creature should, in respect of the future tense say,
<hi>I am with you untill the end of the World, Matth.</hi> 28. 20. he should therein make himself God, who by propriety of nature may still say (<hi>I am</hi>) as it is his nature; therefore this his name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> signifieth that he hath the perfectest being, and only such a being. And thus much of the reasons of his name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elohim</hi> signifieth Power and Judgement.</p>
                  <p>The one sheweth his Might in doing, the other his Truth and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in judging, both which in his name shew, that as it was he that did make the World, so it is he also which shall judge the World at last; for that as the one allureth us to love, so the other yeildeth us matter of dread and fear.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Jehovah</hi> signifieth not only <hi>Hagah</hi> (which is making of things) but also destroying and dissolving of things to nothing again, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 7. 26. where it signifieth calamity and destruction: So doth his name <hi>Shaddi</hi> import not only plenty and nourishment, but also pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and undoing of things. So that in all his names this nature of Mercie and Justice is expressed.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a further thing to observe; for whereas before Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was first placed, and had the precedence of Earth; here the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence is given to the Earth, and the Heaven doth come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde in the last place.</p>
                  <p>Which whether it be the propriety of the tongue (which usually beginneth with the latter thing was spoken of before) or a mysterie to shew closely, that the Heavens were made for the Earth, and not<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62585:99"/>the earth for the heavens, or whether it darkly shadoweth out to us, that in Christ Jesus <hi>Adam</hi> (which is earth, that is our nature) shall be exalted above the highest heavens, in the day of restauration; I will not curiously discusse but allow each sense, as having a good and a godly use to such as be sober minded.</p>

<hi>Sol &amp; homo.</hi> Therefore <hi>Moses</hi> to prevent that evill, that we tie not these things either to nature or art, but that we may ever in all things look up to God, which is before them, above them, and can doe all things without them, and will rule all things after them, therefore he doth teach us this point, he telleth us that howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, things doe concurre, and meet together in humane matters here below, yet we must defie these ordinary means, and evermore glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, who is able, either without rain or the help of man to make the earth fruitfull.</p>
                  <p>Now this which <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh of rain and man, holdeth in all other things as in Fish, Fowl and Cattell: But because it were too tedious to reckon up all the particulars, therefore he maketh choice of the earth and the fruits thereof, which doth most need the help of man, and benefit of rain; for other things being put together, will alone bring forth and multiply by kinds without mans help: But the fruits of the earth are most laborious, for before the earth can bring forth, it requireth our help both to till and plant it, and the influence also of the heavens doe most appear in these things: insomuch as the fruits of the earth may seem to reason, to be the effect of mans labor, and the dew of heaven.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Moses</hi> by telling us that it is not so in this, teacheth us how we may have a right judgment in all the rest, for it holdeth in all, as in this: touching earthly fruits, he setteth down two kinds
<hi>Virgultum agri, &amp; herbas horti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first comprehendeth all that hath wood in them, the other all which have sinowy substance, as every green tender herb hath: Touching which he reasoneth thus, seeing these which need most the labor of man, and seasonable rain were brought forth by Gods power, before either rain or man ever was; Then God is much more<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62585:100"/>able to doe any otherthing without the help of man or any thing else. The fruits of the earth doe need two things.</p>

<hi>Moses,</hi> God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either plough or showers, did cause all things to grow out of the earth, and to bring seed, grain, and fruit.</p>
                  <p>For the meaning of this verse we must mark these three propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>First, that the originall fountain of things naturall as now they stand, is from God, and his blessing, not of ordinary means; for rain, mens art &amp; industry, though they be naturall, yet have they a blessing and virtue from God by which they are available. But to speak more specially of rain, 38. 28. Asketh, <hi>Quis est pater pluviae?</hi> The answer is, God, for he granted out a writ, decree, or mandate for rain,
<hi>Job.</hi> 28. 26. He giveth us rain and seasonable times, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.
26. And as it is his royall power and authority to command it, so is it to countermand it, and to give an inhibition to restrain it, <hi>Esay</hi> 5. 6. And lest any should make exception against him, he saith, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 6.
<hi>It is I which doe cause it to rain, upon one City and not another;</hi> It is not Plannets, nor nature, nor fortune, but God himself, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.
37. We see both set down, his giving out a commandement, for the ground to be wet and restraint for the flesh &amp; <hi>contra,</hi> seeing then it is in his only power to give or restrain, therefore there is a prayer made, a prayer
<hi>nominatim</hi> for rain, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 35. 36. And there is a speciall thanksgiving for this benefit, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 9. And this is the reason saith <hi>St: Augustine,</hi> why God made not the rain as a sweat to evaporate out of the ground and so to moysten the clods, but would have it rather to ascend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into his place, that we might lift up our eyes, to know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that it cometh only from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>The second royall prerogative of God is, that though we have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much rain or men to help; yet all is nothing worth and cannot avail without Gods blessing doth accompany it, which is shewed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollo</hi> may water, there is the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry and rain: but both the tiller and waterer is nothing unlesse God giveth the encrease, therefore we must see and behold God in them all, for if when God sendeth rain he give not his blessing with it and make it <hi>pluviam benedictionis, Psal.</hi> 80. 19. Or if he send <hi>in tempesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam pluviam</hi> unseasonable rain, nor the first nor the later rain,
<hi>Ezekiell</hi> 34. 26. Or if he send it not in plenty, <hi>Esdras</hi> 10.
9. For they had rain yet they wept for want, or if he sendeth too much, what good will it doe the earth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>The third prerogative of God is, that God without rain can make things fruitfull, but the rain cannot doe so without God: It is not these means of tillage or rain that can doe it,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 3. But God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them can doe it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.
11. It is all one with God with a few for quantity, yea with no means to doe things; a little oyle and meal shall streach it self out, and encrease untill rain come: So Christ in<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62585:100"/>want can make <hi>five loaeves and two fishes to feed five thousand,</hi> and so for the quality, the worst and most unnourishing meat, which they durst not give, <hi>Daniel</hi> 1.

                     </gap>. for fear lest they should not look faire, by Gods blessing, made them look with better countenance than the rest which fared more deliciously.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore saith <hi>Daniel, Try us,</hi> for we know that God can doe it without means, or with base means, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 40. the Prophet by Gods word (without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> quality, yea to shew Gods power) could make poysonfull meat, which is contrary to nourishment, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; he made <hi>Coloquintida</hi> to nourish them, which of it self would excoriate the intralls, and scowre them to death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4.</note>The fourth and last prerogative is not only to doe all this but to make that which is by nature clean opposite and contrarie to a thing, that it shall be a means effectually to work his effect; as the putting in salt into salt water can make the water fresh, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to nature, for it maketh fresh water salt, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 20. So Christ by putting clay upon a blinde mans eyes, caused him to see, which was enough to make him blinde, <hi>John</hi> 9. 6. The rock of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, which is set in repugnance to water, <hi>Numbers</hi> 20. 11. yet out of it he caused streams to gush. And this power of God appeared most in the beginning of the Gospel, in setting abroad Christian Religion; for as he <hi>in the beginning out of darknesse brought light,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. So by men of no learning, no authority or countenance, strength or wealth did cause the Gospell to be planted in all the World, that we may know this Caveat to be worth the noting, that he is the cause of things natural now in the state of generation, as he was of things supernaturall in the beginning of Creation. And that we may know that he is able to doe things above, besides, and without, yea, and sometimes contrarie to these ordinarie means; that so we may be taught neither in the want of them to dispair, nor when we have plenty to be proud and presuming in them; but ever look back to God which is above all means, and of himself, as able to doe all in all: To whom be all honour, glorie, power, wisdome, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion for ever and ever,</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:62585:101"/>To this end he declared that God is the Author of second causes; and therefore, as he did all things before them; so now they are, he is likewise able to doe and bring any thing to passe as well without them, yea with means and by causes contrary to such an effect, as well as with all the means that are in the course of nature, or may be invented by the industry of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> then now passeth from the Creation of other things, unto the narration of the History of Man, by the 6. verse, which sheweth the generation of rain, spoken of in part before, that so there might be an ordinary proceeding from one thing to another.</p>
                  <p>Now then to speak of them both apart.</p>
                  <p>First, Touching the Creation of the Rain, we must lay this ground, That God either without vapours or clouds can (if he please) bring store of rain to the Earth, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 17. which plenty by Gods power, was without winde, rain or clouds.</p>
                  <p>But for the naturall generation of Rain, we must note, that there are two issues proceeding from the Earth, which here are set down as the causes of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>The first is a moist or foggie steem or vapour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>The second a dry smoke, fume, or exhalation.</p>
                  <p>It is not wonderfull that the Earth should yeild a dry fume, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is naturally inclined to drynesse: but it is strange that the Earth should give out a moist fume, for that is contrary to her nature and qualities.</p>
                  <p>There are three estates and degrees in the generation of Rain out of the words,
<note place="margin">1.</note>The beginning and originall of it is <hi>vapor expirans,</hi> a moist steem loosned from the Earth:
<note place="margin">2.</note>The proceeding of it is <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por ascendens,</hi> lifting it self into a cloud above:
<note place="margin">3.</note>The perfecting of it is <hi>vapor descendens,</hi> which is the dissolving of the cloud, and so drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping down: these are three proceedings of this generation.</p>
                  <p>God is able to rostrain this course of the rain, <hi>Job</hi>
36. 27. and might have caused <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

104. 13.</p>
                  <p>But being loosned from the Earth, the nature of such a cloud is vanishing and dissipating it self in the Aire to nothing, <hi>James</hi> 4.
14. therefore God bindeth it together in a cloud, and maketh it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact and condense matter, <hi>Job</hi> 26. 8. And for the dissolving of the clouds he is said <hi>Cribrare aquas,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 12.</p>
                  <p>And these are the three proceedings of rain, and the three degrees ingendring it.</p>

                     </gap> shew that by the one he is willing to expresse, that God with more
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62585:102"/>art and regard, did make mans body in the outward form, than he did any other of the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>And by the other, that God did give him a more excellent and perfect soul, which is the inward form within, than he did to any other Creature.</p>
                  <p>To this end he changeth the word <hi>gnasha,</hi> used in making the other Creatures, into <hi>Jelsar,</hi> which he applyeth properly to man; and we know that <hi>formare</hi> is more than <hi>facere,</hi> because the form and fashion importeth a mould in which it must be made, or an especiall Idea artificially conceived, after which it must be made. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as if he should say) you see that man is not made outwardly in the proportion and countenance, which beasts have, for his face is upwards, theirs downwards. That which the Earth brought forth looketh down to the ground; but those men which God made, doe look up naturally to God who made them and and gave them life. That which the Earth doth <hi>producere,</hi> doth also
<hi>prospicere terram.</hi> But we whom God did <hi>formare,</hi> doe
<hi>intueri Coelum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophets and Apostles doe oftentimes delight to use this phrase of speech, and these words, to shew the framing of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, now as
<hi>Esay</hi> 45. 9. <hi>Esdras</hi> 64. 8. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.
20. <hi>Job</hi> 10. 9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 5. and divers other places, in which places they so speak, to shew that the same frame and fashion is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in generation of us, as was in the creation of
<hi>Adam,</hi> and no other manner.</p>
                  <p>In the 4. of <hi>Job</hi> 19. he saith <hi>that brick and tile, and we all, are made of one, and the matter of the Earth:</hi> And therefore that which <hi>Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> calleth <hi>Earthly Tabernacles,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Job</hi> calleth plainly <hi>houses of Clay.</hi> That which <hi>St. Paul</hi> in a better term saith;
<hi>Act.</hi> 17. 26. <hi>We are all of one blood, Job</hi> saith more plainly to the matter, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 6. <hi>We are all</hi> de eodem luto, <hi>made of the same clay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Esay</hi> 29. 16. and 45. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 20. They demand whether it be reason, <hi>that the clay should say to the potter, Why dost thou make me thus or thus?</hi> to shew that we must avoid wandring curiosity and nice questioning to expostulate with the maker, either about the matter, <hi>Why he made thee of this, and not of that?</hi> or about the forme,
<hi>Why he made this man a Vessell of honour, and that man a Vessell of dishonor? Rom.</hi> 9. 20. 21. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 4, 5. We must not search nor pry over curiously into the counsell of the Potter that made us, <hi>but know that his revealed will is, that every one of us should possesse our vessels in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and not in sinne, and sorest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The use of this is that which I have touched before, that seeing we be made of Earth, yet that Earth signifieth good and profitable mold; we were not made of high-way ground or sand, therefore we must not be unconstant or unstable; but we are made of gleabe, to teach us to imploy our selves profitably in our calling, according to the matter of which we came; for else it had been better that our Earth had lien still on the ground, to bring herbs rather than it should now lye unprofitably and idly, in thy skin, to destroy the fruits of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:62585:102"/>Another point for us is, that which partly was shewed also before, That if God could frame us to this proportion and life, out of the dead dust, then why should we once doubt, but that though we be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and turned into dust again, that he can raise us up by the same power? <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. And this is our hope for the resurrection.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore though this be our conclusion, <hi>Job</hi> 7. 21. we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our dust, yet this hope is our comfort that God will one day say, <hi>Esay</hi> 26. 19. <hi>Arise out of the dust and stand up,</hi> even as he every yeer raiseth up the flowers that were withered in the field, and this was <hi>Jobs</hi> hope and comfort of the resurrection, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 26. saying, <hi>I know that my redeemer liveth,</hi> &amp;c. And it was
<hi>Davids</hi> assurance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 5. Who at his death <hi>committed his soul to the God of truth his Redeemer,</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 9. doth then let his <hi>flesh rest in peace untill he be awaked again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This then is our stay in death, knowing that the same God which made us of the dust, hath the same power, and is able to raise us out of the dust again.</p>
                  <p>The second part of man is the Soul: touching which the Prophet by his phrase of breathing into us the breath of life, is willing not only to tell us, that the Soul is the more principall, superior, and excellent part of man, but also that it is farre a more excellent Soul, than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures had, as shall appear by the name and nature of it, here expressed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>In the first part, of which we are to note, that <hi>Neshema,</hi> signifieth a Spirit of two lives, which God inspired into man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly he saith, That that Spirit of lives, was made a living Soul, neither of which is affirmed of any other creature, but of the soul of man only.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 21. 25. We may see that of every other creatures soul, it is said <hi>creavit Deus;</hi> God did beath the soul of man into him: <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith well, that the Soul of all other things is, <hi>quasi cera rudis,</hi> as a rude roll of wax without forme or print; but <hi>anima hominis est cera regis,</hi> as a peece of wax that hath in it the shape or forme of the King, and is made his Seal, out of which for the prerogative of man, which we shewed before, we may ad these.</p>
                  <p>First in respect of the substance, for <hi>Neshema</hi> signifieth a spirituall and heavenly substance, which consideration made
<hi>David</hi> say, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 14. <hi>I am fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi> we have not then an earthly soul, as the Beasts, nor a watry soul as the Fifties, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them out of their elements, but a divine and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Soul, which God himself gave unto us, <hi>Preach.</hi> 12. 7. As the rain is <hi>vapor terrestris,</hi> so our soul may be called <hi>vapor caelestis,</hi> a vapor descending from the heavens, for it is of the same root and nature, which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spirits are.</p>
                  <p>Another priviledge is in respect of the cause, for God is the cause of it, <hi>produxit Deus,</hi> it was his breath or inspiration, and therefore the Heathen called it <hi>Divinae particulam
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> as the body was
<hi>particula terra,</hi> a little cantell of the Earth. <hi>Salomon, Prov.</hi> 12. 17. calleth it<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62585:103"/>
                     <hi>Divina lux</hi> or
<hi>lucerna Dei,</hi> as it were the candle of God, and here it is <hi>spiritus Dei,</hi> which he breathed into our bodies.</p>
                  <p>Now to consider of the words somewhat more seriously, we see that the soul, is a breath, but so that it is <hi>Neshema,</hi> a spirituall and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall breath, which properly is understood of the winde and ayre, by which we see that is next of kynne to the Spirits which have no body, as our bodyes are next of kynne to the wormes that are in the earth, which soul for that cause is invisible but not unperceiveable.</p>
                  <p>As we cannot see the winde and the pulse, yet we perceive them by divers effects: So is our Soul and the excellency of it made known and discerned. And that it might not be imagined or thought, to be only a bare blast of breath, or as a puffe of winde, he therefore addeth a spirit of lives.</p>
                  <p>And least we should deem the soul, and the life to be but one thing, and to end and vanish away together, <hi>Job</hi> telleth us 27. 3. that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or soul of a man is one thing, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> life is another distinct.</p>
                  <p>Though there be a spirit of life in beasts, and not only in earthly creatures, but also in celestiall spirits, yet only the spirit of man is <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus vitarum,</hi> that is, of more lives than one, which our Saviour Christ telleth us in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 28. Men may take away the one life of our body, but they cannot the other life of the soul, that is only in Gods power.</p>
                  <p>This then is the difference between the soul of a man, and all other things, which confuteth the Epicures,
<note place="margin">1.</note>which held that the Soul was but a hot salt humor, to keep the body from rottennesse and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> maketh choice to compare the Soul to breath: First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath a piercing and a searching quality, being <hi>Totus in toto &amp; totus in qualibet parte, Pro.</hi> 27.
<note place="margin">2.</note>This candle of the Soul diffuseth his light, and heat, and life in every member, searching and piercing all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Soul is compared to breath, to humble us and not make us presume on this life, seeing the soul and body is but knit and conjoyned together, <hi>vinculo aëreo</hi> by an airie thred,
<hi>Esay</hi> 2. 22. <hi>Mans breath is in his nostrills,</hi> which being stopped, his life is gone, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 14. 15. which causeth our life sodainly oftentimes; to be taken away, and our soul and our body in an instant or moment, to depart a sunder, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 39. Even because the union that holdeth soul and dody together, is but a little blast of aire and winde easily broken and smitten asunder, so <hi>sodainly doe we passe away and are gone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This may teach us the shortnesse and sodainnesse of this life and death: The use of which is, that seeing we received our life from God, therefore we must now live, the life of all godlynesse, seeing we live by the spirit of God naturally, we must seek for the spirit of God, and the graces of it, that we may live holily: seeing our Soul is the light of God, let not this light become darknesse in us, for then <hi>great is that darknesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing our Soul is the Image of God, we must not deface it, with the ugly form of Sathan: The holy man, <hi>Job</hi> 26. 4. hearing his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62585:103"/>friends speak foolish and vain words, asketh;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> spirit cometh out of them? As who should say: seeing you have the spirit of God, speak not such words, as if an evill or vain spirit were in them: So must we say to those men that doe evill works, Whose spirit, or what spirit hast thou in thee? These deeds are the works of evill Spirits, but thou had'st in thee the good spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>Now we are come to the second estate of our soul, which is set down in this. <hi>So man became a living Soul,</hi> which is added to shew that God not only gave that spirit (inspired into him) a power of life, by which it could live, but also another power unto the body, which before was a dead peece of Earth: wherefore the soul being in every part of the body so made, by and by it was lively in every part, and stood up and performed the actions of life, which now it doth in us: This is a good and profitable sense of these words, as some doe understand. But the best Divines (weighing these words more deeply) doe finde out another state of the soul, which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another priviledge of the soul of man. For besides that it is (as we have seen) a spiritual essence occupied in spiritual actions, being immortall and pertaining and leading to another life. Besides this speciall priviledge it hath here also another common preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, namely, to enforme the body; that is, in a word, besides being a spirituall essence, it is also a natural essence, it had, hath, and shall have a power to live without the body, and also it hath a power in the body to quicken and give life to it, and every part thereof, that is, it can <hi>animare &amp; informare corpus,</hi> which we know the Angels and celestial spirits cannot; for when they appeare in a body, their souls of life (though they live) yet they doe not informe that body; but they are in it as in a Case, which they take to them and leave off again. But our soul is not only a spiritual essence and consistence (as the Angels) but also a natural consistence in the body to inform and animate it, which the Angels have not. And this is the other prerogative.</p>
                  <p>There is none that doe doubt, but they have <hi>naturalem animam,</hi> and thereof they are called <hi>naturales homines,</hi> 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 46. But by their actions one would think that their souls were only fleshie souls, because they never give them selves to spiritual and heavenly acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as a Celestiall spirit shall move them. But only they are given to actions of this bodily life, which is temporall, yea to earthly, fleshie and sinfull actions, as if the soul that were in them were but after that fort a natural soul of life for a time.</p>
                  <p>They see by their natural studies, senses, motions, and actions, that they have a natural soul of life quickning the body, which else could not live. But they think not that it is a spiritual soul and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly essence, which shall have an eternall being after this life, and therefore they never care to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> for such heavenly and spiritual actions of Godlinesse; wherefore we will briefly prove and shew that the state of the soul is celestial and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that we may be moved to think of such actions as that estate doth require.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:62585:104"/>And first that the soul, and the life, and estate thereof doth not depend upon the body, but hath his being and life without the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, after the body is dead and turned to the Earth, because it hath his dependence on God, which is immortall and eternal, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to reason in the judgement of the Heathen, because the soul hath in the will a power and faculty and ability to effect and perfect an action, without any help of the body or power thereof sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately of himself, yea it causeth a man to believe and know many things of it self, even against the bodily senses, and contrarie to them, as that the bignesse of the Sunne and Moon is of a huge great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, though it seem to our sense but two foot, yea the same power of the soul causeth us to desire many things contrarie to the outward sense, as that it is healthfull sometimes to fast &amp; eat nothing, &amp;c. Now of this they conclude that of these things there must needs be <hi>principi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um agendi</hi> where there is <hi>potest as agendi;</hi> &amp; therefore a separate essence and being of the Agent Cause: Thus by this separate action the Heathen rose up to this notice of the separate essence of the soul.</p>
                  <p>Again, the moving of this question, Whether there be a God and eternity, and a Heaven and spirits. This we know, that there is no outward thing which giveth occasion to our senses to move this question, therefore the
<hi>principium movendi</hi> is the power of the soul in reason, who alone by his own light, according to the state of his own nature moveth these things; for a blinde man that never saw nor heard of colors, can never in reason make question of colors; So for as much as there is nothing without to tell or move him to this, they conclude that the soul only was the cause and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it within.</p>
                  <p>Touching the coupling of soul and body together into one living Man, we know that Gods purpose and meaning in it was, that the soul should rule the body, and be a means to lift it up to Heaven and to God, that it might so be made of the same excellent nature and estate which the soul had. But now it is perverted, and by sinne the course of nature and ordinance of God is changed, and naturally our body doth labour to pull down the soul, and make it earthly, base, and miserable. But by grace we must endevor the contrarie; it is Gods will it should be so, and no reason to the contrarie: But men seem by the care and cost they bestow on the body, that the soul is worthy no care or cost at all. But we must remember that many things and much time must be bestowed in seeking to garnish our souls, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>We must lay up treasure in Heaven, Matth.</hi> 19. 21. <hi>We must make friends of this Mammon, &amp; put out our money to the Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Luke</hi> 16. 9. <hi>for it is to lend to the Lord, and if there be any truth in him, he will repay it to their soul, Prov.</hi> 19. 17. If we sow in the flesh, the fruit of all that is but corruption; but that which we sow in the soul and spirit hath his fruit to be glory and immortalitie: and this is the point which we are to cleave unto and hold.</p>
                  <p>You know how little we bestow on spirituall uses for the soul, and how much daily we spend on our bodies; therefore I am an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor

               <p>The place containeth three parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>First, The kinde of place, <hi>a Garden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, The dignity of the place (as I may tearm it) in that it is said (<hi>God planted it.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, The scituation of the place, which is also described in the 6. verses following.</p>
               <p>Concerning the first of these three, we see the place wherein this Creature of excellencie is to be seated, we must needs conceive it to be some place of excellency meet for him, and that either to be some place of pleasure within dore, or else some place of pleasure without, but there was no need for him to have any place of covert or defence within, because there was no such distemperature of aire then; but that they might well enough, yea best of all endure naked, therefore God resolveth to appoint and prepare a meet place without.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, that all the Earth at that time was (in comparison of this as it is now <hi>vallis lachrimarum</hi>) a paradise of pleasure; yet God made this paradise and speciall place of the Earth, a more excellent place of pleasure than any other, in so much that it farre exceeded any other place wheresoever in Earth, both in pleasure and profit, with Herbs, Flowres, Plants, and Trees of all sorts, which were proper and speciall to that place alone. Gardens, as we know are choyce places, severed and set apart from common fields, in which is store and plenty of many choyce trees, and that not in confused sort, but digested into a good seemly order, that so it may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter serve for pleasure and delight.</p>
               <p>It was a most pleasant place in respect of those <hi>tria bonorum genera,</hi> for he ordeined this place for profit, pleasure, and piety: And thus having made it, he appointed it severall for man, and therefore put him therein; Kings themselves, as we see, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 21. 2. doe not take so much delight in their Royall Pallaces, as in their Gardens of pleasure lying commodiously neer their houses: And we read of divers Kings, which being weary of their princely estates and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, have chosen rather to live solitarie in gardens and orchards, and to bestow their time in trimming and planting them, and so to have ended their lives, seeming to preferre this life of <hi>Adam</hi> in a garden before the state of a King in his princely Pallace.</p>
               <p>And let this suffice of the kinde of place.</p>
               <p>Now secondly <hi>it was planted by God,</hi> which tendeth much to the dignity and honor both of the man and of the place; for as God is said, for our service and good, to translate himself into divers shapes; As before he took on him the form and behaviour of a Potter, and a maker of Glasses; so here he is resembled unto us by the name of a Gardiner to plant an Orchard for us and our use: to which end Christ represented and shewed himself in that shape and form, <hi>John</hi> 20. 15. for it was he that trimmed up this Garden of Paradise for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:62585:105"/>Touching this place it is a speciall honour to it, that God did plant it, for <hi>where he planteth he watereth also, with the dew of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and causeth it to give increase,</hi> 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. and therefore when the Scriptures will expresse a place of dignitie and commendation in this kinde, it is said to be like this Garden of
<hi>Eden,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>Esay</hi> 51. 3. <hi>Ezech.</hi>

               <p>There is no Garden of estate, as they say, but hath a Maze in it; So surely hath this garden of God an intricate labyrinch of difficult que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, even <hi>Mare questionum,</hi> a Sea of curious questions, as one of the Fathers saith, but such idle speculative heads, which busie their brains about such needlesse and endlesse questions and curious points, as to know where the place is, and what is become of it now, &amp;c. they shall never finde out any good in Paradise, but

               <p>There are such, and I may say with the Propher, <hi>I pray God there be not such found amongst us in Israel,</hi> for there are with us and in our age which draw every thing to a figurative sense, and by that means of Gods Paradise, they doe make (as I may say) a

                  </gap> Paradise, expounding every thing in it allegorically in another sense, as they doe the book of the Canticles.</p>
               <p>The Fathers distinguish the Scriptures after two

               <p>Now they which take the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> containing matter of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie, and draw them to like allusions (besides that they doe great wrong to those Scriptures) they make themselves very ridiculous. Such there were in <hi>St. Pauls</hi> dayes, as he testifieth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18. which made the doctrine of the resurrection an allegorie, affirming that if a man doe rise from sinne, then all the Resurrection was past already.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Origen</hi> drew Hell to an Allegorie, as if there were no such true and certain place.</p>
               <p>But touching Paradise, <hi>Epiphanius, Chrysostome,</hi> and all the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, doe oppose themselves to such Allegorizers and Wresters of the Scriptures, to overthrow their fantasticall conceits herein; for what say they, though other places besides this be called Paradise, therefore was there no such place indeed. Because <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24. that by
<hi>Sara</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> are signified the old and new Testament; therefore shall we say, there were never any such two women, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
10. 4. because that rock was Christ, was there therefore no such rock as is spoken of <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. 11. Yes, no doubt, and because they were, therefore the Spirit of God doth take a proportion and an Analogie fitly, and shew it between these spirituall things, and them for our better understanding. We doe conclude then, that as there is in man two natures, as we have shewed before, the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of the dust, the other <hi>Neshema,</hi> a spiritual separate essence: So Christ is a person consisting of two natures, God and Man: So that the first <hi>Adams</hi> resemblance to the second
<hi>Adam,</hi> which is Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. And as a man is said to consist of two men, <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and the outward man,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4. 16. So there are two Paradises of Gods planting spoken of in the Scriptures,
<hi>Esay</hi> 51. 16. the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and the earthly.</p>
               <p>This is truth, there is a Paradise of Angels, <hi>Psal.</hi>
103. 20. by which is meant the joyes of Heaven, of which man also (commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating in this life with their holinesse) shall be made partaker in the life to come, yet notwithstanding it is as true that there is an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall Paradise on Earth, which is truly called the Garden of the Lords planting, garnished with all trees for delight and profit. It is no question but that man had his Interest then in both these Paradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and that above is farre more excellent and glorious than this below when it was in his best estate; wherefore we must so place the one which is spirituall and invisible, as that we take not away the other which was visible and temporall.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Adams</hi> posterity dwelt neere to <hi>Eden</hi> afterwards, and serveth in the Scriptures to describe their certain places, by
4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. For <hi>Cain</hi> dwelt towards the East side of this Garden <hi>Eden,</hi> and the South side of it was a Plot, which, after the flood, <hi>Noah</hi> chose as the best soyl to dwell in, <hi>Esay</hi> 37.

<hi>Eden</hi> for the great store of all fruits, which by Gods blessing abounded, for it is recorded that they had harvest twice a yeer, and before the first harvest they were fain to eat it twice, so exceeding fertill it was.</p>
               <p>That which is set down to be the greatest and rare encrease of Gods blessing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 12. <hi>Pliny</hi> recordeth, was an usuall and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary encrease in those parts, that is, to yeeld a hundred fold. And whereas it is usuall amongst our husbandmen to hearten and make fat our land, their industry and labor was contrary, to take away the heart and strength of the ground and to prevent the ranknesse of it, for the which they had barren waters (contrary to the nature of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>) wherewith they watered their ground, because otherwise the eares of Corn would be so great and waighty, that the stalk could not bear it.</p>
               <p>These things remaining as yet in <hi>Eden,</hi> neer about the borders of the Garden, by the testimony both of the Scriptures, and of all other writers, doe prove unto us that there is such a certain and undoubted place upon the earth.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Eden</hi> doth signifie pleasure, <hi>Gen</hi> 13.

<hi>Balaam</hi> describeth this Garden, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 6.</p>

                  </note>Now for the placing of man in it, <hi>Deus locavit hominem quem for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mavit in horto quem plantavit,</hi> for after man was made, God removed and brought him hither into <hi>Eden,</hi> and put him in the Garden, 15. verse, God saith,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 23. <hi>quoniam terra mea est, &amp; vos Coloni estis,</hi> &amp;c. So this Garden was Gods planting and his ground, <hi>Adam</hi> was a forreiner and brought in to be Gods Farmer and Tenant in it, that <hi>Adam</hi> (not being born in it) might know that God which placed him there, was the right and only true owner of it, and therefore all homage was to be performed to him alone, for this taught him that Paradise, was <hi>vos gratiae, non naturae,</hi> for God might have left him in the place, where first he made him; Seeing then God of his free Grace brought him thither, it was not of desert or merit, because as yet there was no Law given unto him, untill after he was put in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of it.</p>
               <p>This then teacheth him thankfulnesse and obedience, in that it was without any desert of his.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it might teach him, that as he was in mercy brought in, so he might in Justice be cast out, if he sinned and became ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we see that as it was Gods great favor, by which he was brought hither, so when he had transgressed, there was no wrong or rigor shewed in thrusting him out again.</p>
               <p>God first planted the senses in man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 9. And then he plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Garden, this is the first order; and another order he took, which is this, that they whom he planted in the Garden, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. 13.
14. might strive with Paradise in fruitfulnesse, that seeing God had caused Paradise not to be barren or unfruitfull to us <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 27. Therefore we should not be a wildernesse unto God, but to be plentifull in good works being thus gratiously planted in Gods Church.</p>
               <p>Concerning Paradise now we must know, it was not the deluge, but the cause of the deluge, that is sinne, which took away the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Paradise as is here mentioned.</p>
               <p>But you will ask what is become of it now? This question may be well left out, because as <hi>St. Augustine</hi> saith, there is no use of it in regard of our habitation, but of our instruction; this, for use, we see and learn, that <hi>Adam</hi> did loose that happy place of joy by negligence, sinne, ungratefulnesse, and unbelief, therefore let us beware lest the like sinnes, make us loose the hope and fruition of our Paradise in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but let us detest such detestable vices which will cause men to lose such excellent glory, yet though we have all lost these pleasures of Paradise by
<hi>Adams</hi> fall, we need not, with too much sorrow lament it, because that was temporall and not permanent, and we are put in assurance through Christ of another Paradise much better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eternall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:62585:107"/>In respect of which, this below was a shadow and nothing else but <hi>quasi vestibulum,</hi> and this first Paradise was but a shew of such store of earthly pleasures and blessings which God is able to bestow on his servan <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>Adam,</hi> we lost earthly Paradise, which was temporall; So by the second
<hi>Adam,</hi> which is heavenly, and his rightcousnesse, we have hope of that heavenly Paradise which is eternall. Again, as the sinne of the first
<hi>Adam</hi> did lock and chain up the first Paradise; So the second
<hi>Adam</hi> shall open the gate of Heaven, and make an entrance of free passage thither. As this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise past was a bodily place for bodies; so the other to come is the spiritual Paradise for our souls: This is <hi>Paradisus veteris Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi> but that to come is <hi>foederis novi.</hi> And thus we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all the places of the new Testament, which speake of Paradise now, for by it are meant the joyes of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Seeing then we are not left destitute of a Paradise, but have the promise of one which is more excellent than that, let us not fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same sinnes of ingratitude and infidelity which we see was the cause of driving
<hi>Adam</hi> out of that Paradise, and will be the cause to keep us out of the second which is to come, for <hi>no unclean person shall enter into it,</hi> 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 15. for Christ will say to such, <hi>Depart from me yee workers of iniquity, Matth.</hi> 7. 23. Wherefore these sinnes must be detested, and infidelity, as the root of all; for his beleeving the Devills <hi>nequaquam moriemini</hi> before Gods <hi>morte moriemini,</hi> was the cause of his fall and of his losse.</p>
               <p>Thus if we beware of this fall and losse, we shall at last not only come to that <hi>Sabbatum cum intermissione,</hi> which was but once a week, but to that <hi>Sabbatum sine intermissione,</hi> which Christ hath appointed for us, and then by Christ we shall be brought and placed, not in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise <hi>cum amissione,</hi> but <hi>sine amissione,</hi> which is eternall in Heaven: In which place we shall enjoy an everlasting Sabbath of repose and rest without any ceasing, and of such a Paradise of pleasures as are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear or danger of losing, as these earthly ones were. All these things are provided for us all, if we demean and behave our selves holily in the faithfull steps of the second <hi>Adam.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">June 8. 1591.</note>AFter the more particular setting down of the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Man (being created) in the 7. verse, I told you that <hi>Moses</hi> proceedeth to set down the place in which man was seated, from the 8. verse to the end of the 14. And the vocation in which he was to be imployed, from the 14. to the 18. verse.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Touching the place we considered two priviledges expressed, &amp;c.
<note place="margin">1.</note>One in regard of the scituation of the Garden, being in the East or right side of <hi>Eden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>The other in regard of the Gardiner which was God.</p>
               <p>Now he goeth forward to commend the Garden in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, namely of the Trees and Plants, which were in it set down in this 9. verse: And also in respect of the waters in the 10. and 11 verles, by which he telleth us, that it was both a well planted and a well watered Garden, and therefore could not choose but be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and profitable.</p>
               <p>Concerning the plants and trees in it, first he propoundeth it in general, and then in special, marking out two kindes of fruits by name, as the tree of life, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of knowledge: Here are two kindes of commendations of the trees and planting it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>The first respecteth the excellency of the fruit that were both pleasant to the eye and good for taste.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, In regard of the plenty and variety, in that there was of every kinde and sort, that nothing might be missing in it, God made it <hi>Nemus,</hi> a grove of pleasant trees good for shadow, and also <hi>Hortus,</hi> an Orchard of good trees for our use and service, that we might not only rest under the shadow, but reach out for the fruit to taste thereof. Both these degrees of excellencie are applyed and attributed to this Garden and to the trees thereof.</p>
               <p>Touching pleasure and delight, we know that there is
<hi>voluptas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mota &amp; voluptas conjuncta,</hi> the one removed farre off, but being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> unto us, applyed to the sense, is very good, and that is the delight of raste; for the eye hath its delight, though the object be remote, but the taste hath no pleasure if the object be not applyed. The one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is transitory; for that which is pleasant for taste when we eate it it is consumed and wasted away in the use of it, but the other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the eye is perdurable and lasteth not only while we look on it, but remaineth long after as delightfull still. God then in this Garden joyned both these delights and excellencies together, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king both concur, that evermore the trees should be <hi>&amp; speciosae &amp; fructiferae, Jer.</hi> 11. 16. Thus much of the excellency.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:62585:108"/>Now I come to the plenty and variety of trees (for it is said) <hi>that out of the ground God made to grow every tree,</hi> that is, every kinde of tree pleasant to the sight and good for meat, which is a speciall commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; for as the Heathen man saith <hi>Non omnis fert omnis tellus:</hi> Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> was fain to send to
<hi>Hyram</hi> for Cedar trees, which his Country afforded not, and
<hi>Hyram</hi> was fain to send to <hi>Salomon</hi> for Wheat and Olives, because his Countrie either wanted that, or else it bare not plenty that year,
1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 15. 10.</p>
               <p>So that all Countries, even the best and most fruitfull, have not all sorts of commodities, but are driven to have enterchange for supply. Only this place of Paradise had plentifull store of all kinds of fruit, and wanted nothing: So that we may truly say of this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as it is said of
<hi>Salomons</hi> time, there came never in any place such trees and such plenty of all as was here, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 10. 12. This then sheweth the bounty and liberality of God, for he dealt not with us sparingly nor with any envious eye, but poured out the aboundance of his blessings on him in this happy place, which sheweth <hi>Adam</hi> in all justice worthy to be condemned as <hi>filius mortis,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 5. in that he having such infinite store of all good trees that were, yet was not content, but did impiously and ungratefully take away and steal from him which had but only one tree.</p>
               <p>From both these we gather, that it is not lawfull in respect of Gods will nor against the Law of nature, but it is allowed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to man in the estate of innocencie to desire and to use and enjoy both plenty and variety of Gods blessing here on Earth which are pleasant and good, that is, such good Creatures which may serve for delight and profit: <hi>David Psal.</hi> 23. 5. giveth God thanks for both, for God gave him balme, which is a thing for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and an overrunning cup, which is for plenty: And
<hi>Salomon,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 9. 21. and in the 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 22. when his Navie went to <hi>Ophir,</hi> he took order, according to the wisedome God gave him, that they should bring him Apes, Peacocks, and Parrots, &amp;c. which we know are only for delight and hath a use for pleasure, so he had both a desire and fruition of such things, and our saviour Christ, which is wiser than <hi>Salomon, John</hi> 18. 2. he often resorted to and reposed himself in a garden and took pleasure therein; and <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 43. there we see he cate of an honey-Combe for the pleasure of taste; and <hi>St. Augustine</hi> giveth this reason, because God caused Bees not to gather honey for the wicked only, but for the godly also.</p>
               <p>The desire then and the use is lawfull, only we must take this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat by the way, and beware that we long not after the forbidden Tree, that is, that we (both in respect of our wills and desires, in regard of the means to obtain and get these things, and also of the use and enjoying them) must beware, that we doe not that which is forbidden: for to desire those things in affection immoderately, to seek them by evill means inordinately and indiscreatly, or to use them in excesse unthankfully, is the abusing and making them evill unto us. And let this suffice for the first part.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:62585:109"/>Now for walking about the Garden,
<hi>Moses</hi> here calleth us into the mid'st of it, and we know that usually in the mid'st of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of pleasure men will have some curious devise, so God applying himself to the nature of men, is said to have a speciall matter of purpose in the mid'st, which <hi>Moses</hi> will have us now see and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider. We read in the 1 <hi>Cron.</hi> 16. 1. that in the middle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in the mid'st of the middle part God caused the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins and the Ark to be set, where his glorie and presence did most appear, for there he contriveth and conveyeth the most excellent things in all Paradise, and setteth them in the mid'st thereof to be seen which were no where else (that is to say,
<hi>the tree of life, and the tree of knowledge of good and evill,</hi> which he expresseth by name, as for all the rest, he hudleth them up in a general term, as not worthy the naming in respect of this.</p>
               <p>Touching which two <hi>St. Austin</hi> saith well, that we must note that they came out of the ground, not out of the Aire, that is, they were not fantasticall trees, as some men have imagined, but very true and substantial trees as the rest, not differing, but only this in preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and special fruit, which by Gods blessing they brought forth, <hi>fructus erat non ex natura arboris, sed ex gratia Creatoris,</hi> as <hi>è contra,</hi> it was not an evill or hurtfull tree, <hi>ex voluntate plantantis, sed ex culpa comedentis;</hi> for by <hi>Adams</hi> sinne it became deadly: We see then that as Paradise was a natural place, though it had reference to a spirituall place; for in this tree of life is both matter of Historie, which proveth the very true and essential being of it, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all matter of mysterie: For as it is a true use to be applyed to the body and natural life to maintain it; So besides that History, in it was a mysterie to signifie a heavenly matter, to be spiritually applyed to our souls, as the Scriptures doe teach: And in these two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects we shall have a perfect comprehension of these trees in the middest.</p>
               <p>Touching the tree of life and the corporal use of it, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it is said in the 7. verse, that God gave man a spirit of life, and made him a living soul, that is, such a soul which could give life to every part in the body, with the functions and faculties thereof, as to eat and drink, to move, goe, and stirre, which the soul of Beasts also giveth to them naturally.</p>
               <p>Touching the natural life and living soul of Man, all Physicians doe well agree with divinity in this, that it standeth in two points, and that there were two causes ordained by God, by which it should be maintained or impaired, the one is set down <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 7. <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum radicale,</hi> the natural vigor and strength of nature in moisture; the other is called
<hi>Calor naturalis,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 1. 1, 2. that is, natural heat: So long as they two are perfect and sound, the bodily life doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue perfect; but when there is a defect or decay of them, then the natural life doth cease and end.</p>
               <p>Wherefore God taketh order that by eating and drinking there should be a supply of that natural moisture, which should be spent in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62585:109"/>us by travail and labor, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 15. And therefore it is called a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and recovering by food that moisture which before hath been decayed in us, now because the moisture and juice which cometh of meats and drinks, would at last by often mixture, become unperfect, as water being mixed with wine is worse, therefore God gave this tree of life, for mans bodily use, that whatsoever naturall defect might grow in these two, yet the fruit of this tree shall be as balm, as it were, to preserve his bodily constitution in the first perfect good estate of health.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though there be no decay of moisture, or that yet sinne, which is the sting of death, might impair or destroy this immortall life, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 16. For when God doth punish or chastise man, for sinne, then even as a moth fretteth a garment, so doth sinne consume our life,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 11. Therefore God ordeined also the other tree of knowledge to a remedy for that, that as the body should be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained by that corporall fruit of life, so his heart also might be propped up or upheld by grace,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 9. which this tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge did teach him to apprehend: And thus much of the corporall use of these trees, which were truely in the Garden as this History doth shew.</p>
               <p>Now for the other part it is not to be doubted, but that as it hath a true matter of history: So it hath in it also a spirituall mystery to be understood as the Scriptures well teach us. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that the tree of life, served not only <hi>ad alimenta, sed etiam ad sacramenta</hi> for doubtlesse as <hi>Adam</hi> in his estate of innocency had a bodily Sabbath, so therein he had a spirituall use of these trees in the mid'st of the Garden, and that in this sort.</p>
               <p>First, for the tree of life it was not so called, as if it gave life to him, for God breathed that into him at the first; But besides that, the tree of life was a means to preserve it; It was also a <hi>Symbolum,</hi> and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall also to put him in minde, to know that it was not <hi>

                     </gap> virtute arboris;</hi> but <hi>vi &amp; virtute divina,</hi> by which he had life at first, and by which his life and length of dayes shall be continued hereafter. In the middest of the Garden was the Pulpit, and this is the Sermon which was preached unto him, by these things which the trees did represent, namely, That <hi>God was his life and length of dayes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 30. 20.
<hi>And that this gratious visitation did preserve his life, Job</hi> 10. 12. As he breathed out his life into him at the first: Again, it did put him in minde, that seeing he had received a spirituall life of immutability <hi>in esse,</hi> so also he received a spirituall life of eternity <hi>in posse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore he had matter and just occasion of thankfulnesse for the one, and of obedience for the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> had two things injoyned him, the one was
<hi>praeesse Creaturis,</hi> the other <hi>subesse Creatori,</hi> he had no need of a Caveat for the one, for he was ready enough to govern and bear soveraignty, but for his duty to God, he had great need to be put in minde; and for the try all and practise thereof, he caused this tree of knowledge to be planted there, with an inhibition not to eat of it, upon pain of death, which
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62585:110"/>now and ever hath offended many. Some wish it had not been in the Garden: Others wish <hi>Adam</hi> had never tasted it; But
<hi>Saint Augustine</hi> saith, if it were good and pleasant, why should it not be there?</p>
               <p>Gods purpose therefore in planting the forbidden tree, was that it might be a triall of his obedience, and practise of his duty, that if he should continue, as he might, and had ability given him, then he should have the greater reward afterward. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> saith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Vincenti dabo edere de ligno vitae in medio Paradisi:</hi> Well saith <hi>St. Paul,</hi> But no man can overcome except he strive first and fight the good fight, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. And no man that will or can strive well, but he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staineth from something, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.
25. For which cause therefore, that we might be rewarded, it was necessary that there should be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and forbidding for his abstinence, that when there should be a tryall of the Tempter saying, <hi>Eat of this,</hi> he should strive and say, I may not, and so get the victory and be crowned, that is, eate of the tree of everlasting life, and live for ever, with God in Heaven: On the contrary side 17. verse if in triall he should wilfully fall, then for transgression, the tree of life should be a tree of death <hi>Mortem morieris,</hi> And the reason of this choice, why God should prescribe him a law and form of obedience, is because this should be <hi>primor dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis lex,</hi> as one saith, <hi>ut nostrum obsequi sit nostrum sapere, Deut.</hi>
30. 20. This is our wisdome to know and doe that which God will have us to doe, if God give a Law at large, every one will consent to it, As if God had said: No man shall disobey or transgresse my will, none will deny it: But let it come to positive law, and bring the triall and practise of that generall to a particular (as to say) I forbid and restrain this tree, none shall break my will, nor eat of it, then is the triall of obedience indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>But some may say, <hi>What hurt is it to know good and evill? For we read</hi> Esay 7. 15. <hi>that Christ shall doe that: And therefore it is no sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note>I answer that God forbiddeth not to eat the fruit, nor that he would have us ignorant of that knowledge,
<hi>quam quis quaerit a Deo, sed quam quis quaerit a seipso,</hi> And no doubt
<hi>Adam</hi> had the knowledge both of good and evill, <hi>per intelligentiam &amp; si non per experientiam.</hi> And he knew how to choose the one, and to refuse the other, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the one, and to fly from the other, he understood it then, but when he would know both by experience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. He could not see why God should forbid him, and therefore the Tempter taking occasion by it, made him make an experiment of it.</p>
               <p>This is the cause then, why at last <hi>Adam</hi> came to know evill by sense and experience, and saw to his shame, what evill was, for to take he knew and confessed by experience, that <hi>bonum erat adhaerere Deo,</hi> as the Prophet saith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>And now he knew by tast, how bitter a thing it was to forsake the Lord,</hi> And that he knew, it appeareth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8. by hiding himself for fear, he shewed that he knew it, when he did feel <hi>ante-ambulatores mortis,</hi> which is sorrow and sicknesse, and when he saw the Statute of death, that now it must necessarily come<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62585:110"/>to him, and all his posterity to dye the death, then he knew evill by wofull experience.</p>
               <p>You see the cause of the Law, and of his sinne of good and evill; it remaineth that we believe <hi>Adam</hi> in his knowledge and in his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience both of good and evill: For by his good lost, we come to the knowledge of the means by which our good may be lost; that is, if we seek to satisfie our lusts, and curiously (not contented with the open knowledge of his revealed will) shall try conclusions with God, and say, what if we should break the Law? Wherefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning these faults, which by experience we see were the cause of evill in him, it behoveth us to receive more thankfully of God the good things we have, and live obediently resting on the Sonne of God for good things to come: And so at last Christ will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the tree of eternal life hereafter, as we have made him the tree of knowledge, wisdome, and sanctification to us in this life.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note>I answer, That whether we respect necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62585:111"/>or pleasure, it is plain, that it was very requisite, that this supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be added; for by this element God causeth all his Creatures to drink and quench their thirst, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.
11. whereas without it they would faint and die: And as this is good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie in the great world, to have every part well watered; so in the little world of mans body is there the like necessity; for in it the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is as a Well or Cistern, out of which every part and member of the bodie, as it were, by the little cords and buckets of the veins, doe draw and receive moisture, without which they would perish; and as the flesh, so the bones are not dry, <hi>but are full of marrow</hi> to moisten and preserve them,
<hi>Job</hi> 21. 24. And to have a generall comprehension of all, the soul also hath a thirst, and must be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with liquor and water of life,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 3. and 42. 2. or else it will be sick, languish, and pine: therefore in the new Testament, <hi>John</hi> 7. 38. Christ, to refresh such thirsty souls causeth Rivers to flow to it.</p>
               <p>As this necessity then tendeth generally to all, so doth it especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to Orchards and Gardens; for it is most meet, that the trees which God doth plant should be also full of sap and moisture, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 16. For <hi>if the young plants doe once get but the sent of the waters they will rejoyce and grow, Job</hi> 14. 9. But without it <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>It is as the grasse on the house top, which withereth before it can grow up, Psal.</hi> 129. 6. And therefore when moisture and waters doe fail abroad, and a drought is come, <hi>Joel</hi> 1. 11. 12. it causeth all men of the Country to weep and howl, wherefore as it was requisite that the fruits of the Trees and Plants should feed <hi>Adam,</hi> so they must be fed and cherished and kept alive by the springs and rivers of waters.</p>
               <p>For pleasures also, it was most meet and requisite that there should be store of springs and waters, for the name of Paradise hath in it the plenty of waters, signifying that the well watering of it made it to be so pleasant a place; for which cause pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is fitly compared to a Well or River, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. 8. So on the other side we say, the drought and want of moisture is compared and likened to sorrow and misery,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 17. 22. And in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament Christ compareth grief and sorrow to it, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 26. wherefore we see that it is requisite both for necessity and pleasure of a place, and also for profit: For as too much water maketh a bad ground for fruit, and unpleasant by reason of dyrt and mire,
1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 9. 13. So on the other side to have a Country or City of too little water, maketh the places dry and dusty, and therefore unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unpleasant, 1 <hi>King</hi> 14. 15. wherefore much land is nothing worth without this: But rivers and springs of waters doe make the Land rich and happie. There must be then in a good Soile not only good Plants and well grafted, but also good Rivers that it may be well watered, or else it cannot be either fit for profit or pleasure; wherefore God so ordered this place, that it wanted not any thing, neither <hi>Pauls</hi> nor <hi>Apolloes</hi> labour, nor yet his blessing of increase from above.

                     </gap>,</hi> and in this place was the Kings royall place and seat in the citie of <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shan,</hi> 1
<hi>Hester</hi> 2. 5. Which for the commodities of it, was called the citie of joy or pleasure, as indeed <hi>Chavilah</hi> signifieth, for in Hebrew it importeth most fruitfull, rich, and plentifull, as if it were ever bringing forth, and yet ever with childe. This is the Country then, that is next neighbor to Paradise bordering neerest upon it.</p>
               <p>Touching the third point, we necessarily infer and prove by the fruits and commodities, which are here named that it must needs be this
<hi>Havilah,</hi> of which we have spoken, for only it hath store of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> things as <hi>Plinie</hi> and
<hi>Strabo</hi> doe witnesse.</p>
               <p>The particular fruits here specified, be those which in the opinion of all ancient writers are set down figuratively, namely one chief for all of that kinde, for it was the infinite store of all these rich com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which made the King of <hi>Persia</hi> so proud in the City
<hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shan,</hi> as we read in the, 1 <hi>Hester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, for Gold, we see that it had not only store, but also store of the best Gold, for there were divers sorts, as we doe make difference of ours here, though there was great plenty of base, and common Gold, which came from <hi>Ophir,</hi> yet the best and purest Gold came from
<hi>Havilah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:62585:112"/>For the other kinde of <hi>Bdelium,</hi> some take it for a precious stone, but indeed it is a tree and not a stone, by which rare and excellent tree all spice and sweet perfumes which did there abound are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and understood.</p>
               <p>The third fruit is of jewels and precious stones, where the best of all is specified for all the rest, namely, the <hi>Onyx stone,</hi> for the
<hi>Sardys</hi> is but a compound of it, and of this kinde of stone we read was set in <hi>Aarons</hi> breast plate, and also we read it to be one of the gates of the City; and the Caldees doe call this stone the mother and seed of all other precious stones whatsoever, and therefore doth contain all the rest.</p>
               <p>And thus yee see what he meaneth by the fruits and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of this land, by which <hi>Moses</hi> thinketh he hath sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed unto us the place where Paradise was.</p>
               <p>Now we must note and understand that all these commodities are in <hi>Havilah,</hi> which is without Paradise, and, as it were, in the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side and out-houses, for these are not the things which doe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally commend Paradise, but by this <hi>Moses</hi> is willing to shew the difference between the worldly Paradise and the Godly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</p>
               <p>For worldlings when they come to <hi>Havilah,</hi> and whilest they are amongst the gold and sweet perfumes and spices and precious stones (which is before they come to Paradise) they sit down there, as if they were at their journeys end, and had found the Paradise and happinesse which they looked for: But Gods Children never stay nor rest themselves in <hi>Havilah</hi> amongst these earthly things, but goe on still till they come to <hi>the tree of life, which is in the mid'st of Paradise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as it is erronious to think that Gods Church is where all these earthly things are: So on the the other side were it erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to conclude, that that could not be Gods Paradise where gold and silver and prosperity is. Because <hi>Havilah</hi> and this
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the circuit and compasse of Paradise; for though indeed the tree of knowledge and of life be the works of it, yet the other trees of pleasure and profit are not denyed alwaies to the Church of God: For God willed the People
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> offer all their treasures,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 4. And yet though these outward things doe accompanie the Church and profession of the truth, yet we are not to rest in them as the true works of Paradise, but as things adjacent, and as part of the world in the outside thereof, yet it is the property of our earthly nature, more to admire these things than the true treasures of Paradise: For when the Israelites saw
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> first, they asked what it was? for they were ignorant of it, they could not understand it, nor tell what to make of it comming from Heaven; but when they first saw gold glistering, they called it by this name, <hi>give it me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no comparison between <hi>lignum vitae</hi> and
<hi>lignum Bdelii,</hi> nor between a wedge of gold and the tree of knowledge, so saith <hi>Job</hi> 28. 16. yet the world thinketh that <hi>Job</hi> was in an error, for they<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62585:113"/>think all knowledge nothing in comparison of a wedge of gold. But remember what our Saviour Christ saith,
<hi>Though we could get all the world, what would it avail if we lose our souls? Matth.</hi> 26. 15, 16. wherefore we must remember to say as

To dwell altogether in these things is as if a man should consume his time, bestow his studie, and spend his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour wholly in mending of high wayes and bridges, and to let alone the care and labour (which is more needfull) in husbanding the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable land and pasture ground.</p>
               <p>And whereas in prophane Stories many doe spend whole leaves and long volumes in these circumstances; we may see the holy Spirit useth very briefly, in a few lines, to knit up all such things as are necessarie to that purpose: Here, in these two verses, he

Notwithstanding all these commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and pleasures of these Rivers, when men abused the places to sinne and abhomination, God threatned his wrath and vengeance on these Nations and Lands, and as before he extended his benefits of his free mercy, so then he powred out his wrath in just Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>And this may suffice for the Rivers, because we may not stand more than needs in mending high-wayes and bridges.</p>
               <p>Concerning these four Rivers, we have said of the ground of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, that it brought fourth all fruits which could be desired of any ground, So say we of the waters, which God had so ordered, that nothing was to be desired of waters, but that the pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light thereof might be found in one of these Rivers. If we compare them together, in some of them was deepnesse, in others shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in some swiftnesse, in some slownesse, some pleasurable, others navigable, the one of them far and fruitfull, the other lean, and yet profitable, <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>Preach.</hi> 4. 12.
<hi>If a man be bound with a threefold cord it cannot easily be broken;</hi> wherefore seeing God hath bound us with fourfold benefits, yea with many fold blessings, what a sinne it is to break asunder those bands by transgression and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfullnesse.</p>
               <p>Paradise it self thus is inclosed with four goodly Rivers, and hath three Islands, which though they be dis-junct, yet they meet in one point, and make but one Paradise,; which Garden sheweth what an one the Gardiner was, that is, three dis-junct in person, and yet but one in unity of substance; which three Islands <hi>Arselius</hi> calleth the three Islands of blessing, and the Heathen doe call them <hi>Elisii campi:</hi> By which we see they had a glimering knowledge of Paradise. The Land of <hi>Babylon, Chuse</hi> and
<hi>Ashur,</hi> and other places, as Writers doe testifie, doe carry in their names the men that first inhabited and possessed them: But only the Land of
<hi>Eden</hi> hath in it the name and title of no man, for God gave it the name. And therefore it is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the most ancient and excellent Countrie, in which man was first created and first set his foot; and therefore some think
<hi>Adam</hi> had his name of <hi>Eden,</hi> but there is no likelyhood of that: But whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver excellencies this Land had, yet now they are lost, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and resemblances of them remain, which must teach us how vile and dangerous a thing sinne is; for as it caused the Ark of God to be taken away, 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 11. and the Temple and Citie of God to be wasted and destroyed, so we see that the same sinnes were the overthrow and dissolution of the Garden of God, and therefore we must beware of it.</p>

                  </gap> and cortain, known, seen and tasted of by many, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 10. So for matter of my story, for spirituall use and instruction,<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62585:115"/>they gathered and delivered some good and profitable things, which their age was able to bear, though our age hold it curiosity, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide it. <hi>Arelius</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Zoroastes</hi> had this as one of his chief Lessons, which he held and taught to all his Schollars, as an Oracle. <hi>That in this life their chief care should be, to obtain Paradise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, where only their Souls should finde pleasure and joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Caldeans also did see that it was a mans duty not to seek a Paradise upon earth, but to contemplate a spirituall Land and place of pleasure, which the heathen in their Books called <hi>Elisii Campi,</hi> In which they place the four cardinall virtues, instead of the four pleasant Rivers which are here named: And also <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the depth of <hi>Pishon</hi> to the profoundnesse of wisdome, the shallownesse of
<hi>Hiddikell</hi> to temperance and sobriety, <hi>Tygris</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and <hi>Euphrates</hi> to justice.</p>
               <p>So doth <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew, fall into the like spirituall meditation of Paradise for his use, he said, this is the course which a man must take here, to seek the light of knowledge, and hereafter the participation of the light of glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sirah</hi> 24. labored in this comparison, likening the four Rivers in Paradise to true wisdome, and that which floweth from it: So there is a Paradise above, which is spirituall, a tree of life and knowledge, and such streams and rivers spirituall, which our Souls may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend for instruction and comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Augustine</hi> and <hi>Ambrose,</hi> have gathered two other resemblances spirituall by this out of the old Testament, <hi>Ezech.</hi>
1. 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4: 6. They lay, that Faith on earth doth apprehend Heaven, and therein these four things:
<note place="margin">1.</note>God the Sonne as in the form of a man having a fellow feeling and compassion of our infirmities and miseries on earth.
<note place="margin">2.</note>And also as having the strength of a Lion to save and defend us.
<note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, as an Oxe to be made a sacrifice by his death:
<note place="margin">4.</note>And lastly, as an Eagle to mount up again, by his Resurrection and Ascention.</p>
               <p>They say, they are, as it were, the four streams, in which our Faith doth run and direct his course in, by meditation of heavenly Joyes in Paradise above.</p>
               <p>Again, he taketh another out of <hi>Ezech.</hi> 15. 16. There are saith he, <hi>four Wheels on Earth,</hi> which have a sympathy between them and the Beasts above. And as these Wheels move on earth, so doe they move or stay in heaven. The four Wheels are these, <hi>Job</hi> 4. 6. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, fides, patientia, integritas,</hi> For if we so <hi>fear</hi> that we have <hi>faith,</hi> and hope in Gods
<hi>mercy,</hi> and patiently endure as Christ did, not digressing from righteousnesse, for all the troubles of this life. As these things in our hearts move well, or stand still on earth, so doe these four Beasts and streams in heaven move and flow to us, or stand still from yeelding us any comfort.</p>
               <p>Thus doth <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Ambrose,</hi> make a profitable resemblance and comparison, between these things on earth and that which is in heaven, that it may be a course to lead us to Paradise above.</p>

               <p>And now he intendeth to set down the manner of his placing and imploying him in that place.</p>
               <p>His placing is set down here in two points.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>First, By shewing us the place from whence God took him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the place to which he brought him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Then he sheweth us that the things in which he was imployed were double.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>First, in regard of his body, He was enjoyned the duty of labour, as is shewed in this 15. verse.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, In regard of his soul, the duty of Obedience.</p>
               <p>In the two next verses, the Fathers term them <hi>Cultura horti, &amp; Cultus Dei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We must begin with his placing: Touching which first he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us that God took him from another place before he brought him to this. If we ask from whence God took him? We are to understand that he was taken out of the common of the World, as when he had transgressed the commandement, he was cast out into the wide world again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 23.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> seemeth to tell us, that it is a very profitable meditation, to look back into the former place, and estate, from whence we were taken, <hi>Esay</hi> 51. 1. So did <hi>Anna</hi> in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 8. and <hi>Mary</hi> in the new Testament,
<hi>Luke</hi> 1. 52. in their several songs: <hi>God doth raise the base from the dunghill, and set them with the Princes of his People, Psal.</hi> 113. 7.
<hi>Joseph</hi> was taken from the Dungeon and prison, <hi>Psal.</hi> 105. 17. and brought from thence to be chief Ruler in <hi>Egypt.

               <p>This then being Gods course in <hi>Adam</hi> at the first, from base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to honour, from the wilde field to Paradise; So ever after he used the same order in his posterity; and therefore will have men consider and confesse their <hi>unde,</hi> from whence they come.</p>
               <p>So the old Church were bound to acknowledge their <hi>unde,</hi> and to say, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 5. <hi>My Father was a poor Syrian, ready to perish with bunger, and was after in cruel bondage in Egypt, &amp;c. and from that poor and miserable estate the Lord brought us into Canaan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:62585:116"/>This then kindly worketh in us the conceit of humility to consider and remember that first Man was a companion to Beasts, both in the same common matter and place, untill Good took and brought him into a more excellent place.</p>
               <p>As we have spoken of the place from whence, so now of the place to which he was brought, That was Paradise, wherein we must note, that God brought him not thither only to shew it him, that he might see it, 1
<hi>King</hi> 8. 9. but that he might inhabite it, enjoy it, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse and exercise himself in it, to which he seemeth to have relation in the 10.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 14. which proveth that <hi>Adam</hi> was not there <hi>natus, sed positus,</hi> nor thereof <hi>Dominus, sed Colonus,</hi> and he had it not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, but by Deed of Gift; not <hi>naturâ, sed gratiâ</hi> he was not a Citizen but a Denizen; he was a Proselite brought in thither from some other place.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>The second word was <hi>posuit,</hi> as who would say, Man was not able to put in himself, he could not come thither alone, but it was a thing supernatural, even a speciall grace of God who put him in this place, not mans natural wit or industry.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this being a shadow and resemblance of Heaven, it is sure that (whatever we say) it is not our merit or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, our wit or any thing else which can bring us thither, but only the free grace of God, which, as it teacheth us humblenesse in regard of our <hi>unde,</hi> so it teacheth us thankfulnesse in regard of our <hi>quo,</hi> whither; that is, Paradise: a place full of all pleasant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable things, and our thankfullnesse must be <hi>with trembling and fear, Psal.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Quoniam qui potuit poni, potuit deponi, &amp; qui potuit ferre, potuit etiam auferre,</hi> as he did indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>The third point is his <hi>ut,</hi> that is, the cause and end for which God took him from the World and put him into Paradise, which was to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> him some service, both in dressing and keeping the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as also in doing homage unto him that he might know that he was but a servant in Paradise, and had a Lord and Master Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount farre above him, and therefore that it was his duty to be carefull and thankfull to God for his benefits: Also this labor was imposed him, that he might understand that this Paradise was not an estate and place of his rest and all happinesse to be looked for, but rather a place of strife, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7. which when he had performed at last, he should be crowned with this end, which is double, and containeth the two vocations of every man: The one respecting the Common-wealth, The other God in his holy Church.</p>
               <p>Touching the first, which is set down in this verse, concerning bodily labour, there are two questions to be inquired of, the one of
<hi>Adam,</hi> the other of Paradise.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>The question concerning
<hi>Adam</hi> is, <hi>Why God should
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> him to such labour, seeing God purposed to place him in a most happy estate? for it might seem a thing very inconvenient to impose labour to him which might marre and hinder all the felicitie and happinesse spoken of before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:62585:116"/>
                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note>For answer to that, It is true which <hi>St. Augustine</hi> saith, that indeed, if we mean
<hi>Laboriosum laborem,</hi> it would have been a prejudice and let to his happinesse; But if by this is understood only such a pleasant labor and exercise of body, in which a man taketh more delight and comfort, than by sitting still, then we cannot otherwise think, but that it should have been father a solace to him than any hindrance of joy. For the labor that maketh us miserable now and cometh in as a curse for sinne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 11. 9. it consisteth in three points.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>First, urgent necessity is irksome to many when they are inforced to it, or else they should not eat.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, when it is with the sweat of our face above our propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of strength, even to the straining of nature, not only to make us warm, but even till we sweat again.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, so to labor hard as when we have done all that we can, there shall come either unseasonable weather, or such a barren state of the ground below, by reason of the curse, that our labor shall take no good effect, but shall cause thornes, bryers, and weeds to grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Wheat which we did sowe.</p>
               <p>But remove these impediments, and then labor is a speciall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, that excessive labor is wearinesse and toile to the flesh: But when labor is <hi>Condimentum volnptatis,</hi> as rest and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> now to us is <hi>Condimentum laboris,</hi> then such a labor is better than doing nothing at all.</p>
               <p>This then being set down, that labor is not simply an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and hindrance to a good life, but rather sometimes a help to it; then we infer that amongst all other labors, the exercise of dressing and keeping a Garden or Orchard, is most pleasant and agreeable to our nature,
<hi>Preach.</hi> 2. 5. and bringeth greatest delight to our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and senses in seeing ever some new and pleasant hearb or plant springing up.</p>
               <p>Therefore it seemeth to be even the labor in which Kings have taken delight, <hi>Preach.</hi> 2. 5. though of all other men, they seem to be exempt most from bodily labor, yet they have often used and tied themselves to this labor, which God here assigned to <hi>Adam,</hi> his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor being therefore limited and allayed with these considerations, there was no abatement of happinesse or joy thereby.</p>
               <p>The other question to be inquired of is, whether it may not seem superfluous and more than needs, in regard of the Garden, for him to dresse or keep it; for seeing God made all things to grow in it, and the ground to bring forth all things to be defired why should he labor to dresse it? and seeing there were no ill things to hurt or annoy it, what need he to take care to keep it? <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> saith, that the case standeth alike with God and with Gods Garden in this respect, for as man hath more need to be served of God, than God hath need to be served of man (not wanting his service) so <hi>Adam</hi> had more need to be served by the Garden, then the Garden to be served and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to by him. But all the Fathers doe agree in this, that it was Gods will that the Garden should bring forth not only <hi>opera <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> of his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62585:117"/>own accord, but also by the industry and diligence of man, it should bring <hi>opus voluntarium.</hi> So that divers other faire and pleasant things, should be bestowed on the Garden, and caused to grow by his labor, and so he should both <hi>discere &amp; docere,</hi> how many things by industry might be done above nature.</p>
               <p>Now for the keeping of the Garden, it may seem a great difficulty, because there being no danger, it might keep it self without
<hi>Adams</hi> care, labor, or looking to: But the ancient writers say, there is a double keeping, the one is from danger, the other to our selves for profit. And both these kinds are, either of the keeping the thing it self, or else of the revenues and commodities which come thereby. As for example, If
<hi>Adam</hi> had not broken the Law and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God then he should have still kept the Garden to himself, and for his posterity for ever to all our uses, without forgetting our estate or causing a reentry to be made. Again, He should have kept the fruits of the Garden to his own use moderately, and kept them from being wasted lavishly, for those things are said to be well kept, <hi>Quae bene dispensata sunt &amp; non male;</hi> So that by a moderate use, he should have kept the fruit from riot and waste.</p>
               <p>Again, touching the keeping thereof from hurt, God closely telleth him, that an enemy should come, who by his cautelous wyles and subtill practices, should seek to bereave him of his present Garden, and therefore that it behoved him to keep it from such an enemy, who by indirect and sinister means did seek to defeat him of it: And thus we see that this labor is necessary, without either inconvenience or superfluity:</p>
               <p>I come now to the first (<hi>ut</hi>) for it is of three sorts; And this first is the principall and greatest, for example <hi>

               <p>In <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10.

               <p>We are content to labour and to doe our duty in the ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we doe see the fruit thereof.

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and labour to serve God.</p>
               <p>What is this commandement and our duty prescribed?</p>
               <p>When we have taken away the shell and driven off the husk from
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62585:118"/>it, we shall see that it is true obedience,
<hi>obedientia autem est sola virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> as one saith, <hi>&amp; nulla est obedientia nisi humilium,</hi> so that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in humility containeth in it the summe of all virtues else. This is the first speech and dialogue that God had with man from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: As therefore hitherto <hi>God hath opened only his hand to fill Adams hands with his blessings, his mouth with laughter, and his heart with joy;</hi> So now God openeth his mouth to shew what shall be his reciprocall duty for all his benefits, and what duty he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of him: It is not said before, that God spake touching the delivery of the former duty, because it was no need; for the very light of reason might teach him the law of honest labour and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, for the avoiding of idlenesse in every estate. But this Law and duty of obedience is supernatural, and therefore besides the instinct of nature it was requisite that God should (<hi>viva voce</hi>) instruct him therein as a thing not within the reach of fleshly reason, to know how we should serve God aright: This is the reason then why God spake now and said, <hi>Numb</hi> 12. 6. God is said to speak three waies, <hi>by vision, dream,</hi> or <hi>mouth to mouth;</hi> and this last was the speciallest favour and grace so to speak; If <hi>Moses</hi> then stood so highly in Gods favour, that he delivered his minde by word of mouth, face to face, then no doubt did God much more speak after this familiar sort to <hi>Adam</hi> now, because he was much more in the favour of God then any of his sinfull seed were, which the ancient Fathers doe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently gather also by the 3. of
<hi>Gen.</hi> 8. for in that it is said, that <hi>Adam heard God walk in his own presence in the Garden, and heard also his voyce speaking to him,</hi> they conclude that God did, before sinne, appear to man in a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> shape and speak to him, as we read the Angells did to many afterwards.</p>
               <p>As God in Paradise spake to <hi>Adam,</hi> so did he alwaies, both in the old and new Testament, make known his will, and reveale our duty in Religion touching his worship by the word of his mouth. The Prophets therefore had this for the warrant of their Prophecies, <hi>Os Domini loquntum est;</hi> and the Apostles had this for the seale and assurance of their doctrine <hi>Ego accepi a Domino quod tradidi,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. So that if in Paradise to have the word of God as the rule and direction to frame all their lives by, being in the state of innocencie, then no doubt our state now cannot be happie without the same rule, unlesse we have Gods word among and us to live thereby. The Fathers for this cause doe term this as the Sermon which God made to <hi>Adam;</hi> and they say that he should have had no other Scripture, nor Bible, nor Sermon but this, if he had obeyed it, and stood in his innocencie, neither should he have had any other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments then the trce of knowledge and life, So that in it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all divinity
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> est,</hi> &amp;c. as who should say, God made a Statute or Law, when he said, <hi>Thou shalt dye the death;</hi> And indeed in all the course of Gods<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62585:119"/>proceedings against <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. is meerly Judiciall, as if God had tryed him and his actions by this Law which here he made.</p>
               <p>There are two principall parts of this Law.</p>
               <p>The one conteineth the authority of the Law-maker, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
               <p>The other conteineth the tenor or summe of it.</p>
               <p>In the Law it self there are three parts as it is in all Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>First, A preamble, which is an inducement and perswasion for us to obey and heare.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, The restraint of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, The sanction and penaltie of the Law.</p>
               <p>And if we marke it, there is none of all these but conteineth in them an argument very effectuall and very plain, to make us have a care to serve the Lord and obey his Commandements; for if we shall not obey his authority and just right which he hath to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us, we shall shew our selves very proud and perverse persons, which is the overthrow of humility; if we regard not his liberality, we are unthankfull men, which destroyeth humanity and civility; if we transgresse so gentle and easie a Commandement, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding negligence; if we fear not, nor regard his threatnings, it sheweth that there is in us hard-heartednesse and incredulity, which is the cause of all.</p>
               <p>This is then as if he had said, hitherto God hath been in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as no God, he hath shewed himself as a Minister to man, taking on him the behaviour of a Potter, to fashion us of Earth; and of a Glasse-maker, to inspire our bodies with his breath; and to be to us a Gardiner, and to be one that hath occupied himself in making Rivers for water and all things needfull for us, in so much as no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant may seem to be in offices more meanly imployed than he hath as yet undertaken for us: But now, saith <hi>Moses,</hi> God will forget himself no longer, but beginneth to shew himself to be a God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and to sit down in his Throne of Majestie and royall authority, and call man to him as his servant and subject, and giveth him a commandement, and prescribeth him a Law touching the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. We first say that on Gods side and behalf, he hath a power to command, because he hath made us and giveth us all that we have; and so on our side there groweth and ariseth a duty and necessity to obey, because we have received such and so many things, for so we say <hi>ex beneficio indebito oritur debitum officium:</hi> So we see the field, receiving seed, is thereby bound to return back somewhat to the sower: So the child naturally yeildeth himself bound to obey his Parents, though there be no covenant or bond drawn between them, and this is <hi>naturalis obligatio:</hi> So that this bond of nature and law is so strong and bindeth us so strictly, that we shall be as surely bound by it, if we obey not God and our Parents as if we had gone to a Scrivener and there had an obligation drawn and made strong against us; yea, it doth not only as much binde us, but farre more, because the obligatorie law naturall is farre more<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62585:119"/>strong and bindeth us more surely than the bond of the Law mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and indeed it sticketh neerer unto us, in as much as this is by Gods finger written in the Tables of our hearts; but this is only graven in tables of stone or rolls of paper without. Man is called <hi>Imago Dei,</hi> and was made so, yet he was not God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be left or ruled by his own will, for that is the main
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to which Satan would perswade
<hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. 5. namely, not to follow Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, but to doe that which seemed best in our own eyes; and being brought to that erronious conceipt, God faith, <hi>Loe, the Man now will be as one of us, q.d.</hi> he will be no more subject to Gods will, but will shake off that yoake and be equall with us; wherefore, that <hi>Adam</hi> might know his ranke and row, in which he is placed and standeth under God, he giveth out this commandement and Law that he might know this, <hi>that though God hath in mercie put all things under his feet, Psal.</hi> 8. 6. yet he reserved a power and prerogative to command, and therefore we must acknowledge a duty to obey: Gods Will
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and his Wisdome must be out direction; if Gods will be <hi>praecipere,</hi> then our will must be answerable to it in obedience, and <hi>our humane wisdome must be captived and brought under, and made subject to the wisdome of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Gor.</hi> 10.
5. for this is the chief part and perfection of obedience, <hi>to deny our wills and forsake our own wisdome, Matth.</hi> 16. 24. the reason is because our will and wisdome is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie and at enmitie with the Will and Wisdome of God.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the use of Gods authority forward from him to us in commanding, and backward from us to him in obeying: And if we be willing inwardly, laying down our own wills and wisedoms, and ready outwardly to manifest it in action, then God will take on him to give us the tree of life, and a promise of eternall blessednesse for ever, and so we have a full comprehension of his will and purpose in commanding and giving this Law.</p>
               <p>There are now two difficulties and doubts which usually arise out of this commandement, and therefore are to be assoyled.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object. 1.</note>The first is, <hi>That seeing</hi> Adam <hi>now is in the state of innocency and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, therefore Laws and Commandements are needlesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object. 2.</note>Secondly, <hi>Seeing God knew</hi> Adam <hi>would break and transgresse it, it may seem that God was very hard and cruell in giving him that Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Resp. 1.</note>Touching the first objection, It is true that <hi>St. Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Justo non est lex posita.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Resp. 2.</note>And to the second, It is as true which he saith, <hi>If there had been no Law, then had their been no trangression,</hi> and so no punishment, and so it had been very well with all men still: Indeed in some sense the words of <hi>St. Paul</hi> doe sound very well, if we understand them as he spake them; for all Laws have two parts, the one directive, the other corrective: So <hi>Paul</hi> saith, That he which keepeth the first part of that Law which is directive, and so becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth just, he shall never need to fear the other part of the Law which is corrective.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Object.</note>The second objection which accuseth God of hard dealing, is like that other objection in the new Testament, namely, <hi>Seeing that</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:62585:120"/>
                  <hi>Christ knew that Judas would betray him, John</hi> 6. 71. <hi>why did he make choise of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Resp. 2.</note>The answer to both is this, namely, That the foreknowledge of God is no cause of any action, no more then our eyes, being open and seeing a man, is the cause of his going; wherefore Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge is <hi>extra seriem causarum,</hi> as the Schoolmen say: God gave <hi>Adam</hi> power and ability and freedom of minde to perform a greater obedience than this, <hi>Preach.</hi> 7. 31. <hi>but man sought the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own heart, and followed not the will and counsell of God;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is sure, that seeing the Law given to man is most

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the power which man had was most perfect, and seeing he was not constrained to transgresse, but was forewarned of it; therefore man knowing Gods will and yet willfully breaking it, is the cause of his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and God is justified to be without all rigor whatsoever, except we will say, Why did not God then make man immutable? which question if we move,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 20. we are not to dispute &amp; plead with God, though this reason may be yeilded thereof, first, <hi>quia ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitas non habet legem,</hi> God would not make him immutable, for then man must needs be God, for only God is so. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>necessitas non habet laudem:</hi> for what thank, praise, or reward could he have had, if he could not have chosen, but necessarily must obey, as the fire by nature must needs burn and goe upward; wherefore we should rather (saith <hi>St. Augustine</hi>) magnifie Gods goodnesse and benefits which worthily requireth our obedience, and contemn our own unthankfull disobedience. This is a more profitable course of meditation than to knit many knots and make many questions to reason with God.</p>
               <p>Now we come to the Law it self, which I divided into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, body, and penalty of it; of the which, the first is introductive, the second directive, and the third corrective.</p>
               <p>The body of the Law we see is planted between the preface and the penalty, both which are to perswade us to the love and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of that in the mid'st. It is therefore faced and garded with the consideration of Gods love and liberality, and it is backed behinde with the fear of Gods just judgement, if we break it. The first is set down as a spur to prick our dull natures forwards to obedience; for who would not be stirred up with love and liberal rewards: The other is set as a bit or bridle to keep us back, at least from trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression: So that if perswasion or threatning, love or fear, fair means or foul, will serve to keep us from sinne and make us serve God, here God had put them all together.</p>
               <p>This preface is of the admirablenesse of his love and goodnesse which he promiseth before he commeth to the poor restraint of forbidding that

               <p>In this plenty and variety granted, God permitteth to him the best, which is the tree of life, and he gave him the means <hi>unde vive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, bene vivere, &amp; semper vivere possit,</hi> for all the trees were means to sustain his life.

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is the body of the Law it self; And then<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62585:121"/>after it in the end of the verse insueth the punishment, if we breake it.</p>
               <p>In this former part of the Law we observe two points,
<note place="margin">1.</note>First, The subject of the Commandement, concerning which the restraint is made, that is, the tree of knowledge.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, The action it self restrained, that is, eating, which may be resolved two wayes, as the School-men say, <hi>Quando actio cadit super materiam indebitam,</hi> that is, either when an action is forbidden from lighting on it which should not, or when it is invested with all his due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
               <p>In speaking of this, we will take this course, first to entreat of the subject and action here expressed, and then of the application of it to us: The subject is a Tree, and that but one tree of knowledge, which tree with the fruits of it, were without question no more evill than the other trees, for all alike God saw to be good, as we have seen; and therefore it was such as might have been eaten, as well as the other, if this restraint had not been.</p>
               <p>And again if this restraint had fallen on any other tree in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as it did on this, it had been as unlawfull to eat as this: So that it is not the nature of the tree, but of Gods word which made it evill to eat, for there was no difference between them but in respect of Gods word and charge, which said, <hi>Thou shalt not eat thereof.</hi> In which respect it is called
<hi>the tree of knowledge of good and evill.</hi> We must understand that this tree hath not his name of every quality in it, but of the event and effect which should come by it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 25. The Wise man calleth it
<hi>lignum dolorum, Eccles.</hi> 38. 5. of the effect and event it had of these waters. So in <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 8. there is a tree called <hi>Arbor lamentationis,</hi> not that the fruits thereof would make a man sorrowfull, but for the casualty and event which happened and befell Israel there; not that it was the cause of any lamentation: So we must know that whereas <hi>Adam</hi> before knew good both wayes, both by contemplation and experience, now having broken the Law he knew evill both wayes also: we had the knowledge of good and evill morall by naturall contemplation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7. so long as thou doest good to thy self, men will speak well of thee; So that to know good is
<hi>bene pati;</hi> while he did <hi>bene agere, Dicite justè quia bene, Esay</hi> 3. 10. 11. <hi>The just shall eat the fruit of their righteousnesse, and the wicked the fruit and reward of their sinne,</hi> and this is the other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evill, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 18. there was knowledge of good and evill, by sight, sense, and experience, <hi>Psal.</hi> 133. 1. this is shewed that <hi>malum culpae</hi> was the cause of <hi>malum poenae,</hi> and by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the bitternesse of the punishment, he knew how bitter a thing it was to forsake God and not to fear him: So he knew the good of obedience, by the good of reward, which was, the sweetnesse of pleasures before his fall; and after his fall he knew the evill of sinne by the evill of his punishment. The one knowledge is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. the other kinde of knowledge is,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 12. If we follow. <hi>St. Augustine</hi> and

                  </gap> Gods will, and so it should exactly teach that to be good, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it in obedience, and that to be evill which is contrary to it by transgression; for the knowledge could not be more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> set down, then by this object and action, <hi>Thou shalt eate of these, and shalt not eat of this,</hi> God then by forbidding them to eat of the tree of knowledge, did not envy or grudge that they should have knowledge, but rather made this rule the root of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to them, that the science of good and evill is taken only from Gods <hi>dicendo,</hi> that is, things are therefore good because God by his word alloweth them, and are evill because he forbiddeth them.</p>
               <p>Now touching <hi>St. Augustine,</hi> He saith, this is called the tree of knowledge in respect of the event, in regard of the exeperimentall knowledge, which man had by it, both because by it he had felt the reward of obedience, so long as he stood upright, and also by it he found and felt by experience, the reward and penalty of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for when he had contrary to Gods word reached his hand to the tree and eaten of it, he had experimentall knowledge by and by both how birter a thing it was to sinne and forsake God,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 19. and also how good and sweet a thing it was to stick fast to God by obedience, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 28. He found that in the action of obedience was life and happinesse, and in the act of sinne was death and wretchednesse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> before
<hi>Adam</hi> had eaten of the tree he had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good by contemplation and experience, and so for ever should have had: and then he had argumentall knowledge by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption and contemplation also of evill; for he by the argument of privatives must presume this conclusion, that if he doe that which is forbidden he should be deprived of the tree of life, and that happy estate, and so consequently must needs come to death and all misery, which he found to be most true by wofull experience, so soon as he had put it in triall: And thus much of the object and of the name given to it.</p>
               <p>Touching the Action which is the second part, in which I mean thus to proceed, by way of certain positions and grounds, the one necessarily arising out of the other.</p>
               <p>We lay then for the first ground, that it was not lawfull for God, nor behoofull for us, that God should make triall of <hi>Adam</hi> who he had made, for it is equally expedient and right in the practice and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of men, first to make proof and triall of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, before they will make any reckoning or commendation of them as good laborers, so God tried <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22. 12. that he might have experimentall<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62585:122"/>knowledge of his obedience, and say <hi>nunc scio, &amp;c. Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing for my sake thou hast not spared thine only sonne:</hi> So he proved <hi>Israell</hi> at the waters of striffe, and
<hi>Job</hi> by an other triall. So God had knowledge of man whom he made, that then he was good, but he would by triall see, whether he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Second, it was meet, that seeing a triall must be made, that it should be by some externall thing, in which this outward obedience and practice might appear, as masters doe make triall of their servants obedience in some such work; <hi>Doe this, Goe thither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So seeing Gods will was, that <hi>Adam</hi> should be a spectacle in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Angells and all other Creatures, therefore it was necessary, that he should prescribe the place, and triall of it in a visible and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible object, and in a thing which might be manifest to good and evill Angells, to see and behold him; This is the cause and reason, why God saith not, Thou shalt not desire to lust in thy heart after the fruit of this tree? Because that action and triall of the heart, soul, and thought, God only could discern, <hi>for he only trieth the heart and reins,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.
39. Therefore he saith not, <hi>non concupisces, sed non comedes,</hi> for that that action is apparant.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, it was convenient and seemed good to God, that it should be made by a restraint and interdiction, that as before, idlenesse was forbidden and taken away by labor, so here licentiousnesse of lust might be restrained by saying, <hi>Thou shalt not eat of this tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Fourthly, God saw it good and meet, that it should not be generall but particular, and brought to a speciall instance of this one tree.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5.</note>Fifthly, it seemed necessary to God that this triall should not be in a particular of naturall obedience, but rather in morall and positive obedience, in which this commandement consisteth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">6.</note>Sixthly, as it was a positive and morall thing, so was it to be made in a thing indifferent, for if it had been a thing naturall and simply evill or good it had been no triall: As
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith, if God had said, the fruit of this is poyson, he would not have done it, or if it had been such a thing which had been a detriment or hurt to God, he would not have done it for the vile nature of it, wherefore God placed this triall in a thing indifferent, which by its own nature was not hurtfull to man, neither could bring any hurt or detriment to God; So that God would have the triall of his obedience stand, not in the nature of the thing, but only in this respect, that it was Gods will to forbid it, that <hi>Adams</hi> triall might be this. I can see no reason why I should not eat of it, it is as good to eat, and as pleasant to look to, as any other fruit, but God hath restrained it, and said, <hi>Thou shalt not eat of it,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not.</p>
               <p>Lastly, God in this triall giveth no reason of it, but maketh it an absolute Law, simply saying, <hi>Thou shalt not eat of it,</hi> for else man might think that he might doe it for the reason sake; for this maketh plain the perfect pattern of true obedience, when we doe it only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62585:122"/>Gods will and not looking for any other reason whatfoever. Thus we see why God look't our this speciall tree of knowledge, and laid this prohibition on it.</p>
               <p>Now out of this we gather and say, that the making of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And subjects are bound to obedience, though they see no reason but that the meat is good and allowed of God.</p>
               <p>I come now to the applying of this to our selves,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 32: Christ willeth them to learn a parable of the fig-tree: So the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which we may learn out of this tree, is most excellent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, even the whole body of divinity: Before we come to the pith and marrow of it, we must first break and pluck off the husk or shell, for the Leviticall Laws (as the Fathers say) are as <hi>Aarons</hi> Almonds which his rod did bear, <hi>Numb.</hi> 17. 8. in which was <hi>Cortex &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla,</hi> and if we can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> crack and take off the shell, the sweet kernell of instruction will soon appear: The husk and difficulty of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is, that God should inflict such a penalty for the taking and eating such a fruit, this is that hard shell that few can crack: But our rule is, that we must not stick still at the shell, but break it, and cast it away: Therefore this is our rule in all such Laws, That not the outward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the thing commanded, but the power and authority of the commander and law maker is to be respected, as the pith and substance of our duty; Therefore we say that the principall summe and scope of the morall Law, and the pith of it, is expressed in these two terms, <hi>Bonum ost faciendum, malum est fugiendum, Psal.</hi> 34. 14. And this is known and received of all; but here is all the question, what that good is, and what is that evill? If any make this question, why is this thing good and to be done, and that thing evill and to be avoided? If we say, as <hi>Eve</hi> did judging it by reason, and by the nature of the thing, as to say, I see and know that it is good, pleasant and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to our nature, and therefore it is good, and I may doe it, that were to fetch and draw the rule of God from the nature of things, as if it were in the thing it self; but it is said, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.
12. 13 <hi>Though meats be made for the belly, and the belly for the meats,</hi> yet if we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>è contra,</hi> that is evill whatsoever it be that God forbiddeth and saith thou shalt not doe it, for things are good and lawfull only, because Gods word saith it is so, so that every thing taketh his goodnesse only from Gods word; And this is the pith and marrow of this commandement, Therefore
<hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 32. God saith, <hi>Whatsoever I command you take heed ye doe it, thou shalt put nothing thereto, nor take ought therefrom,</hi> As if he should say, my commandement and will shall be the rule and direction of your will and works; so in the new Testament <hi>St. Paul</hi> saith, we must not be wise above that which is written, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. But that we be sober and know and understand according to sobriety, which is to prove what every thing is, by the perfect will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2.3. This then is the difference between Gods commandements; and those which men doe make, when men (though they be the greatest) doe command any thing, they therefore doe command things because they be good and lawfull, and when we deal with them, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obey their Laws, so farre forth as the things they command are lawfull and good, because their words and commandements have no power to make things good: But when we deal with Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, we simply obey all that he willeth because his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and word doe make things absolutely good, ye though they before may seem to be evill, yet after he hath commanded them, they are made therefore perfectly good, <hi>Nos volumus qua bona sunt; bona autem sunt quia voluit Deus.</hi> Gods good will therefore is the best and most beneficiall thing for us and our good, and the things he commandeth are the wisest things for us to follow, howsoever they seem to corrupt reason and sense, which are ill Judges in those matters. Thus much then for our application and use, that when our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are agreeable to Gods word and law, then they are according to Gods will: And therefore we may be sure that it is best for our behoof.</p>

                  <note place="margin">June 22, 1591.</note>EVery Law hath in it two principall parts, the one containeth the body and tenor of it, the other comprehendeth the sanction and penalty: Touching the body of the Law we have entrcated already, both of the subject, and also of the action of it; Now therefore we are come to the latter part, to consider of the punishment threatned to the breach of it; concerning which we say, That as there is required necessarily in the Law giver authority and right to command, so likewise in him must be a power and ability to correct and punish the transgressors, or else his authority is without an edge. Both these there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62585:123"/>are seen in the Law-maker by the parts of this Law; the one being the directive part, serving for direction, the other being the corrective part, which serveth for execution; And every one may be sure that he is subject and under one of these. This then is as if <hi>Moses</hi> had said, Gods <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<hi>That in that day thou shalt dye the death,</hi> for death is the sower and bitter sawce of this sweet meat, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.</p>
               <p>Touching the punishment in it self, we are to know, that in every punishment inflicted for offence, there is required Justice to give it in a due proportion, that there be an equality between the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and offence; As in the Law, he that will desire another mans Sheep and steal it, he in justice is to restore four-fold. Again, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and equity requireth that the punishment must be of greater force to

               <p>Such an equality is in this; For because he took liberty to stretch his will and desire further than he should, therefore that he should lose the first liberty he had; for this is just and equall, <hi>

               <p>Touching the second point, which is concerning the cause of his death, which must not be ascribed to God, because the cause is found in our own selves, for God saith, <hi>If you eat you shall die,</hi> that is, you shall be causes and authors of your own death; your blood light on your own heads, for I am not guilty thereof, which we shall the better percive and esteem, if we consider that which before I have shewed, that <hi>Adam</hi> was made immortall, <hi>non necessitate naturae, sed vi

But notwithstanding this subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to mortality, and possibility to dye, in regard of their nature, Gods grace did sustain their bodily life, and kept them from death, so long as they kept themselves from sinne. But now si hence trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, besides the necessity of nature, their sinne also did pluck death upon them, and was the cause of this curse: So long there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as man kept his first estate, he was united to God, which was life, and had use of the tree of life, which then was <hi>

Thus we see God justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this sentence saying, <hi>Morieris,</hi> because he is neither the Author or Cause of <hi>Malum naturae,</hi> which is <hi>sinne,</hi> nor yet of <hi>

                  <hi>But it may seem hard and unjust, that seeing only the Body did take and eat of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, that the Soul also should be condemned to this death as well as the Body.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note>But to satisfie this doubt, the Fathers say, That as well the Soul as the Body was in the transgression alike guilty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Justice should be alike punished, and this they make plain by this familiar parable and comparison: Be it (say they) that a blinde man and a criple or lame man should be in an Orchard, and this one charge should be given alike to both, that upon pain of death they should not take and eat of this one tree; The blinde man of himself could not steal of the fruit, because he could not finde where the tree was; the lame man for his part could not alone take of the fruit, because (though he saw) yet he was not able to goe to it: So when neither of them without other could be guilty, they conspired both together and agreed, that the blinde man should carry the lame man to the tree, and so to take their pleasures, and fulfill their desires, by which means they both became guilty of death: Such a thing (say they, in resemblance) was between the body and the Soul; the Soul had a desire and appetite (being forbidden) but could not perform the Action, wherefore the inward affection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in moved and conspired with the outward action of the body, and so perfected the sinne joyntly, and therefore together are worthy of this death.</p>

                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:62585:126"/>to Almighty God, which is first) are bound to have a most speciall care and regard of their duties in that other society, which is this, If they be Husbands, their next care must be of their duty to their Wives; if Children, of their duty to their Parents; if Servants, of their duty to their Masters; for these duties of the private Families in the Common-wealth, are next in honour and reverence to the divine duties which we own in the houshold of Faith, which is in the Church unto God; for this society is <hi>lege ipsa antiqua,</hi> as one saith, and therefore we must give more honour and reverence unto it.</p>
               <p>Now for the summe and scope of this verse, we will divide it into two parts, first into Gods <hi>Dixit,</hi> and secondly into the tenor of his speech, which is, <hi>Non est bonum,</hi> &amp;c. and first briefly of
<hi>dixit Deus,</hi> because we often heard of it before, we must note, that
<hi>qui dicendo facit, verbo facit,</hi> which teacheth us to give honour to Christ the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond person in Trinity, who is <hi>the word of God, of whom all things are made and ordained, John</hi> 1. 3. Secondly, touching this
<hi>Dixit,</hi> which we see by it and other singular prerogatives herein given to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, which we may add to all the former.</p>
               <p>For in the creation of other Creatures, God used only the word of authority <hi>fiat,</hi> but here he useth the word of his good will and pleasure which is <hi>faciam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before he ever directed his speech to that which was not,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 3. saying <hi>fiat lux,</hi> when there was then no light but all darknesse; But now he reflecteth his speech to himself, as it were, consulting with deliberation about this work, in that the Contents of his speech, in touching the good and happinesse of Man, in foreseeing what is not good for him, in providing that which is best for him, we doe not only see his care over us above other Creatures, but also we are taught to acknowledge how well and reverendly we ought to esteem this ordinance of marriage, for God knew that many spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and reproaches would arise among men against this work which God had in hand, of making Woman. Some by way of jest and merriment to disgrace that sex, and others in contempt to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise them, calling them necessarie evills, &amp;c. therefore God saw it needfull to expresse the absolute good which cometh to Man by Woman, as being so necessarie that we cannot be well without them; for seeing we cannot deny, but that God that doth best know what we want and what is good, doth affirm that it is good for us to have <hi>Eve</hi> made, and that it were evill for us to be alone without her, therefore that we pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ume not foolishly in jest nor ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest to contradict and crosse Gods will.</p>
               <p>The tenor or content of the Consultation standeth upon two parts, The first is a reason or cause which moved God to make <hi>Eve</hi> in these words, <hi>Non est bonum,</hi> &amp;c. The other is his purpose and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to make him a help; the form of both which standeth thus, <hi>I will make her to be a help to him, because it was not good for him to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:62585:126"/>Touching which the Fathers doe say, That now a pawse is to be made, because this form of speech which is first used, is to set down the true and right use of Logick, which is the art of right reasoning, or cause which moveth God to make <hi>Eve</hi> in these words,
<hi>Non est bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> &amp;c. the other is his purpose by argumentall conclusion; for they observe well, that all the speeches which hitherto have been used, have been imperative, absolutely commanding things to be done: So that Gods authority and will is the only reason of all that hath been done: But now at the making of Woman God useth a speech of argument and reason, concluding and informing the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessitie of this work; which also must teach us, to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ule to direct us in the immortality of our actions, namely, to consider, as here God doth, what is good touching our actions, and what evil may come by doing and not doing it: if we in sound judgment can say <hi>bonum est,</hi> then we are to conclude this, <hi>ergo faciendum est:</hi> If right reason telleth us this <hi>malum est,</hi> we are taught to resolve upon this conclusion <hi>ergo non faciam:</hi> So that the rule of reason is in all things to consider, whether it be good or bad. Again, He saith not <hi>Non est bonum mihi, sed non est bonum domino,</hi> that is, he respecteth more the good of others, than of himself, this is Christs reason which he used and moved in all his actions,
<hi>expedit vobis ut hinc abeam, John</hi> 16. 7. which is to teach us to doe the like, for it is <hi>q.d.</hi> all one because it shall be better for his, and the perfecting of his estate; therefore for his sake I will make him a meet help, which example must teach superiors how to frame all their reasons and actions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies respecting the common good of their inferiors more than their own private commoditie, for we shall see it both here and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that God maketh the good and welfare of his people the ground of his Decrees; so may we observe the like in the reversing that which he had decreed, to punish them and destroy them for sin, yet if they repent of their evill, God will reverse his Decree for their good, which <hi>Jonas</hi> knowing <hi>Jon.</hi> 4. 7. saith, that God doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by this means seem to make his Prophets lyars, because that for the good of mankinde he doth often reverse and revoke the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence denounced by them against wicked men; wherefore we may well say, that Gods goodnesse is as much seen in caring for the good of man, being made, as in creating man, which was nothing before: All which he doth that the consideration of his love and goodness to us might be, as it were, <hi>cords &amp; links of love to tie us unto him in all duty and obedience, Ose</hi> 11.
4. and to teach us to frame all our thoughts words and deeds to the augmenting of the glorie of God; As to say, Because it is good and acceptable to his glorie I will doe this, &amp; <hi>è contra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the reason, and first to the antecedent thereof, in which we see that God doth set his heart upon Man, being made, that now he taketh a speciall view to see whether he can espie any good thing to be wanting about him which he might supply. We read in the end of the first Chapter,
<hi>that God,</hi> looking upon man,<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62585:127"/>
                  <hi>saw all to be very good,</hi> yet here he that thought man by creation <hi>to be very good,</hi> saw a detect of one good thing yet, which might make much for his perfection: And therefore he taketh order here to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him with it, that nothing might be wanting to those that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>
               <p>By this therefore it appeareth that solitarinesse is counted an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in Mankinde, but not in God; for he being most perfect, yea, the perfection of all things, needeth not any other thing to be adjoyned to him as a companion or help meet for him.</p>
               <p>Therefore he is and ever will be set alone, and will be called
<hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus sapiens Deus,</hi> as the Psalmist saith. <hi>Thou art God alone:</hi> But among the Creatures this sheweth all things to be imperfect, in that it is not well with them, if they be alone; For the perfection of Angells is in multitude, being an Host: The perfection of Mankinde, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the civill perfection, is in societies, by which Families, Cities, and Common-wealths are made; so we may mark that solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: God in the Creation doth at least double every thing, that it might not be alone. In the firmament he made great lights and lesser lights: The waters were made double, the upper and nether waters: The Earth had herbs and trees: And as for Fish, Fowl, and Beasts, he made all things in aboundance. <hi>Salomon</hi> sheweth, in the 4. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9, 10, 11. that above all other Creatures it is most meet and convenient for man, in divers respects, not to be alone, and concludeth the point with <hi>vae Soli,</hi> because it is not good for man especially to be alone: And therefore when our Saviour Christ calleth his Disciples, it is said, <hi>he sent them out by pairs, two and two,</hi> because he would not alwaies they should be solitary and alone, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 4.
<hi>Luke</hi> 10. 1. But there is no rule so general, but that hath his particular exceptions in some speciall causes, unlesse it be in moral rules, of good things commanded by God, for against such there is no exceptions to be taken. But in the rules of naturall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse touching conveniency, we may ever in some instance make an exception, As (<hi>Husay</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.
7.) <hi>this counsell is good, but not at this time:</hi> So we may say, the light is good for all, yet it is evill and hurtfull to ill eyes: So may we say of solitarinesse, that sometimes it is most good &amp; meet for a man to be alone in solitarinesse; so it is good and most meet for some man to be alone without companie; for so <hi>Moses</hi> said <hi>Leprosus habitabit solus,</hi> that is to avoid infection. God saith of his Schollars <hi>Ducam eos in solitudinem &amp; docebo eos,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oftentimes solitarinesse is best for Students, and so our Saviour Christ often frequented solitarie places for private prayer, as most fit for it. Thus we see generally how this is to be taken, but more particularly we must consider of it in the speciall case of Marriage, to see how this is verified in a single and unmarried life, whether (in that respect) it be not good for all men to be alone.</p>

7. 36. he saith, if a man doth marry he doth not sinne therein, for Christ saith of the Angells, they neithey marry nor are given to be married, and yet they are holy, they sinne not, because they doe not marry, yea their estate is better with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out marriage, than <hi>Adams</hi> was in Paradise being married;

<hi>Eve</hi> or the Divell; for as <hi>St. James</hi> saith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.
14. It was not so much any outward occasion as his inward and corrupt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupifcence which made him to sinne; But be it that she was the cause of fall, yet from whence then came that occasion of evill to him, <hi>Non'e, e latere viri,</hi> why then, out of himself came all this cause of sinne.</p>
               <p>But if any shall complain yet further of the womans hurt and fault; let us know that this woman was made by the counsell of God, the means and occasion by which amends was made, and that with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for the evill, for all the evill which she had first done, for as she brought forth sinne and death, so she was a means to bring forth a holy seed, which should bring eternall righteousnesse and life unto all, for as the Serpent should deceive the woman: So it was Gods purpose, that the seed of the

               <p>Now for the second part, we see that after deliberation, God cometh to this determination and saith, <hi>Faciam adjutricem,</hi> where we may mark that God saith not <hi>fiat,</hi> as when he made other Creatures, but
<hi>faciam</hi> which is a word of advisement and wise deliberation, whereas

               <p>In these words therefore we have first to <hi>consider</hi> Gods commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and warrant, for the ministring and bringing together all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures before the man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Adams</hi> answer returned <hi>non est inventus,</hi> for after his diligent search, it is said he found no meet help; for the first, because it is Gods royall prerogative, to cause all the creatures to make their appearance at a certain place and time, which man of himself might not presume to take upon him; therefore God giveth over his right by a letter of Attourny and <hi>dedimus potestatem</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> by which he might lawfully, both take a streight survey of them all, and also impose names to every one of them as he pleaseth, which (see) that this writ and warrant is given out to all the living creatures here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low saving unto fishes, the reason whereof is, because that if there were any likelyhood at all, that man might finde a meet companion and mate for himself any where, then it must needs be amongst one of these two kinds of creatures, either amongst beasts of the field, or fowls of the aire, for there be some agreement and conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62585:129"/>man and beasts and birds naturally, but none at all between the fish and us, the beasts (as we have seen) are made of the same mould and matter which we are made of, and the fishes were made of the slyme of the waters, and not of slyme of the earth: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because they have naturally divers notes and voices as well as man, but the fish are mute and dumb, and therefore unmeet for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Thirdly, beasts and birds doe feed on earthly things as we, and breathe and live in the same aire and place which we doe, and doe delight naturally in the sight and company of man, and easily will be made tame, sociable and serviceable for man, whereas
<hi>è contra,</hi> the fish neither feed nor breathe as we doe, they cannot live in the same place and element which we doe, but are as it were inhabitants of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother world below us, and besides this, they will by no means be made tame and sociable to us, nor be serviceable to us, but only at our table for meat, wherefore they being as it were of another world, and of another nature and disposition divers from ours, they could not be meet for our company, and therefore in vain had it been to have called them into this solemn assembly of earthly creatures, God is said then to bring all these creatures before man, therefore they came not at mans call, nor yet of their own accord, but by the speciall commandement of almighty God: And indeed without Gods powerfull commission we may come to them, for they will not come to us, or if they come, it is to doe us hurt, or to make us affraid of them, <hi>Job</hi>
39. 12. This word then of God which brought them together, is not an audible word, <hi>Sed vox in silentia,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>Job</hi> 4. 16. And it is called Gods whistle, <hi>Esay</hi> 7. 18. for if he call, yea if he doe but hisse and whistle for innumerable Caterpillars and Froggs, they will speedily come in swarms to doe his will, <hi>Psal.</hi> 105. 34. Thus we see that <hi>verbum illud quod produxit, idem adduxit haec omnia Adamo:</hi> By which words we may observe, that God doth also now invest man into his rule and dominion over all the creatures, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them before him, as their Lord, to doe their homage unto him, for it was the like custome in <hi>Israell</hi> when any was annointed King, that all <hi>Israell</hi> should suddenly come together before him, that they might know and acknowledge him to be their ruler, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 17. Such a like thing is here; for all creatures by Gods appointment doe as it were meet at a Parliament by generall consent, to annoint man to be their King: Now in the next place we must consider the end; why this solemn assembly was made, the principall thing indeed is to discover to <hi>Adam,</hi> that amongst all the creatures which were yet made, there was not one meet and worthy enough to be his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as it may appear in the 20: verse. But withall, there is besides it a second subordinate end, which is, that man should give names to all creatures, and to see how <hi>Adam</hi> would call them, by which we see that God loveth not dumb shews, and will not have
<hi>Adam</hi> idle in beholding his creatures, but would have him to exercise that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which God had given him, in giving them names, for it is said to be a wise part, by the outward sight and view of things, to be led
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62585:130"/>to an inward and wise consideration thereby; by which he might learn instruction, so will God have him too, while he looketh over them, first, to be led to a wise consideration of the natures of the things that he seeth; and then to give fit names to them, according to their divers natures, which by sight he perceiveth, which we have seen to be the very order that God useth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 4. So soon as he saw the light, presently he is said to consider of it, namely, that the nature of it was good, and therefore presently proceedeth to give it a fit name agreeable to the nature which he saw to be in it.</p>
               <p>In the first, God doth establish in man (as a meet thing for that reasonable creature) the speculative part of wisdome, which is the duty of meditation, study, and contemplation, which is expressed by the word (seeing) for so the prophers were called in the old times (<hi>Seers</hi>) of this, 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 9. And again we must know, that this specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation by study and reason looking into the nature of things, is not only lawfull and allowable in divine matters, which is the studie of divinity, but also in the generall study of naturall Philosophy, by which we may look into the nature of all the creatures which God hath made, which is by nothing else but by meditation to call them to minde, and then as having them before us, wisely to consider of their natures and names, so <hi>David</hi> did confesse, <hi>That he did often me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate of all the works of Gods hand, Psal.</hi> 143. 5.</p>
               <p>Another point, that <hi>Adam</hi> was not only enjoyned to see and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of their natures and names, but also to utter in words and in names, the things which in his wisdome he had conceived of them, by which God doth as it were, untie the string of his tongue and open his mouth, that by speech and audible and sensible words, he might shew and utter his wise conceipts, for the communicating of that knowledge which was in him unto all others after him, to this end therefore God made him a tongue as well as eyes, that his wisdome and learning should not be buried in his breast, but might be expressed for the good of others, by which also we doe see the approbation, commendation and allowance, of two other notable Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences given unto man, namely Grammer and Rhetotick, by which our mouths are opened to utter knowledge aright, God cannot abide, that men should misname things, as to call things which are good, by evill names, or to call evill, good, <hi>Esay</hi> 5.
20. Therefore God will have him take a speciall view of all things, first, and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to name them: First therefore we must have knowledge by studie and contemplation, before we take upon us to professe it by eloquution.</p>
               <p>But now a dayes, it is not as it was at the beginning, for we take upon us to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>David</hi> saith, when men have houses and lands of their own, then they take upon them as<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62585:130"/>having most right, to call them after their owne name, that is, to give them what names they please to impose: So doth God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self reason, 45 <hi>Esay</hi> 4. <hi>I have called them by my own name,</hi> therefore they are mine; It was God's course in 17. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. when <hi>Abram</hi> had vowed his subjection to God, by the Sacrament of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and given himselfe to bee his servant; then God, to shew his authority over him, gave him a new name, calling him <hi>Abraham:</hi> So was it the custome of kings and princes, having by force of arms made any subject unto them, to shew their soveraignty over them, they used to alter their names, and call them by names of their own inventing, as we may read, 2 <hi>Kings</hi>
23. 24. for of <hi>Eliakim</hi> is called <hi>Joakim,</hi> and
<hi>Mateniah</hi> is called <hi>Zedekias,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24. 17. So here God having made all things subject to man, and him the Lord and Ruler over them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. to declare that royall prerogative which he had, he giveth him also leave and authority to give them what names he pleaseth, and so they for ever should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>Which also doth argue the great and rare wisedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which <hi>Adam</hi> had in this happy estate; for it is a great point of wisedome, so to distinguish the natures of Gods Creatures, as to give them fit and proper names expressing their natures; he knew, as it appeareth, not only
<hi>rerum Idola,</hi> but also was able to give <hi>verborum idiomata,</hi> that is, such a propriety of words and names to each seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thing, whereby their divers natures and qualities might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned: The man therefore gave names to all the Cattell, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The reason of the Mandate or Writ, as we have heard, was partly to honour man as Gods Lievtenant on earth, and as Lord of all his Creatures, and partly to express, the great and singular wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge which God then had induced him withall: The Content of which, was to call a generall muster and assembly of all his Creatures before <hi>Adam,</hi> that a survey might be made, to see whether any meet help for man might be found, to avoyd soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tariness, because it was not good for him to be alone; and it was Gods purpose at this solemne meeting and Parliament to invest man into his dominion, and to declare him to be their Lord by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them names.</p>
               <p>Now in this verse is first contained the execution of the Writ, shewing all was so, and then in the latter end of the verse, is set down the retorn of the Writ, in these words (<hi>he found not a meet help for him.</hi> As the Commandement had 2. parts, namely, the considering their natures, and giving them names; so hath all wise men distinguished by all the ancient Hebrews calling some men of profound judgement and deepe knowledge, and others, men of eloquence, and excellent judgement and utterance: Both which gifts of God hardly are found together in any one man,

<hi>animal rationis &amp; orationis particeps,</hi> with which no other earthly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is endowed, therefore the ancient Fathers have noted in
<hi>Adam's</hi> two estates, the one to be <hi>pater viventium;</hi> the other to bee <hi>pater scientium,</hi> that is, <hi>The Father and teacher of all knowledge;</hi> for as <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> is said to be the father and author of Musick <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 21. so may <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> be said to bee <hi>pater Theologiae, Philosophiae, Gramaticae, Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricae,</hi> &amp;c. hee was the first that practised Contemplation, and the first that practised Eloquution, by that excellent light of nature which God had given him; and the first, as here wee see, that gave proper, sit and significant names and words to expresse the natures of things, and hee was not only the father of all the liberal Sciences, but also of all mechanical Arts <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>pater agriculturae,</hi> &amp;c. by all which wee briefly see the perfection of his minde, and the excellency of his gifts with which hee was endowed: So that
<hi>Adam</hi> then must needes bee granted to bee the first and the chiefest Author of all Knowledge and Learning that ever since, in all ages of the world hath beene among men, for from him it was derived and spread abroad among his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, into all parts of the world, for <hi>Adam's</hi> knowledge both of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and all other natural things was derived to the house of

7. 22.

<hi>that as the man called them, so should their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Now we are come from this generall consideration of his tongue and language to consider of the names in particular which he gave. Touching it I will give you but a taste of a few, because it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite to reckon all the excellent significant and most fit names of the Creatures which he gave:
<hi>Adam</hi> having first severed the Beasts from the Fowls, as being distinct in nature, among all the Beasts he seeing a Horse, he knew that God had made him for man to ride and trundle upon for his case and better speed, doth therefore at the first sight, according to the nature of him, give this name, which in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifieth a swift Runner. So seeing the Sheep, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God had made them to beare wooll to cloath and keep warm, he by and by calleth him the man clothier. An Asse he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the mase Porter, because he knew his nature was to carry mens burdens, &amp;c. So for the Fowls, he seeing the Eagle to be the Prince and chief of Birds, giveth him a name of the noblenesse<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62585:132"/>of his nature: The Peacock he calleth a pround Bird, of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward property of pride which he knew to be in him: The Stork he calleth the gratefull, loving, or pitifull bird, for the dutifull care and kindnesse which he hath of his Damme. So for creeping things, he calleth the Serpent by the name of subtilnesse or deceivablenesse, which knowledge of his dangerous nature might have made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware and take heed of him: The Locust hath his name of going out in swarms: The Bee hath his name given him of his artificiall cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning workmanship, with which God hath naturally indued him, in making his Combes of honey and waxe. By all which <hi>Adams</hi> great wisdome and insight into the nature of things is seen, because the name doth so fitly answer the nature of things. And thus much of the execution of the Decree concerning the denomination of Creatures.</p>
               <p>Now we are come to the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of this Writ, which is set down in these words, <hi>He found not a meet help for him:</hi> Touching which we may observe, that he returneth not the answer of this, that he had given meet names to all the Creatures, by which they should be called for ever. But letting this passe, he saith, that <hi>He could not finde a meet help for Man,</hi> which sheweth indeed that this was the most chief and principall end of the assembling the Creatures before him, that he might finde a help and fit companion for him, if any were; for not finding argueth a seeking, and seeking argueth a desire to have a companion like him, and that desire argueth a want, which want made him to seek diligently, but he could not finde; therefore here he returneth <hi>Non est inventus.</hi> This is then <hi>q.d.</hi> somewhat
<hi>Adam</hi> found by search and seeking, namely, the divers natures and qualities of good Creatures which were made for his good: But yet because they were all bruitish and unreasonable, he refused them all to be his mate; for in
<hi>Adam</hi> God had placed naturally, not only <hi>appetitus socii, sed etiam similitudinis,</hi> that is, to be one of his own kinde, nature, and disposition, but he found none as yet.

Now after man had made his confession, that he found a want, being in solitarinesse, but could not finde a fit supply; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this verse insueth the narration of Gods workmanship in the Creation of woman.</p>
               <p>In speaking of which, first it may seem a course strange and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62585:135"/>to flesh and blood, and unsavorie to reason, that woman should be taken out of the side of man.

                  </gap> more wonderfull and incredible than that which is here spoken of. In respect of God therefore we must know it to be all one, as easie a thing, and of as litde labour for him to make a man of the side of man, as to cause him to be made of the seed of man, though in respect of us (which are sensual) that seemeth most credible which is most common and usually seen of us.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>The second thing is, That the Woman is said to be made of one of his ribs, of which, if any seek a reason, this may serve for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>Quia sit aliquid ipsius,</hi> for this is that which maketh the bond and knot of Matrimony sure and fast, when they consider and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themselves to be a very natural part one of another; and therefore
<hi>St. Paul</hi> saith <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 28. <hi>they must love one another as their own flesh;</hi> for how could <hi>Adam</hi> choose but love her, being
<hi>bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh,</hi> seeing it is natural for man, not to hate his own flesh. Also it is for the better procurement of love of Parents towards their Children and Posterity, that Parents and Children might thus think, <hi>Quia sumus ex uno, sumus unum:</hi> for all this is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to commend unity between man and wife, because they be but one; and also between brethren and sisters, yea, and all the Posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> because they all came of one. This all men should think, especially brethren, because we were hewed all out of one rock and digged out of one pit; therefore why should we be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded asunder, rather we should say as <hi>David</hi> doth,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 113. 1. <hi>Behold it is a good and pleasant thing for Brethren to dwell together in unity.</hi> This consideration then, must be a means to establish unity and peace among all men, especially between man wife and children, and their family.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>But another question may here be made, <hi>Why she was taken out of his side, rather when he was fast asleep than when he was awake, for it is sure, that God could as well have done it when he was awake, if some speciall purpose had not moved, in which it seemed best to him to have it thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note>To answer this objection we may say, that men have sought out many inventions and devises: Some, to satisfie it, have imagined that it was done, because <hi>Adam</hi> should not feel any smart or pain in the opening of the flesh &amp; taking out of the rib, which being awake they think he must needs suffer otherwise, and (say they) <hi>Quia agritudo &amp; dolor est poena lapsi:</hi> therefore God would not, nay (say they) he could not in justice let them suffer in Paradise, so long as he continued holy: But it is sure, that if that only had been all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that God, to have prevented that, could have so taken her out
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62585:136"/>of his side, that he should have felt no grief or pain thereby, though he had been awake and looked upon him; for if God had but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended the act of sense for a time, which at the first he gave him, he should have had no grievous sense of pain on that part.</p>
               <p>But indeed this rather may seem to be the reason, Because God in his work would have none seen or present with him. But be as it were, by himself alone, least any should fasly and foolishly suspect that <hi>Adam</hi> being present and awaked, should have been some help or means, and had somewhat to doe in the Creation of the Woman; therefore he would be alone, that he alone might be known to be the only maker of the Woman, and that he had no help or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell in the framing of her: For the like cause God suffered the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples to fall into a deep and heavy sleep in the garden, when Jesus Christ our Saviour was in the agony, that it might not be doubted but that he alone wrought and brought to passe all the work of our Redemption without the help or comfort of his Disciples, as it was prophecied of him before, <hi>Ille Torcular calcavit solus.</hi> So Almighty God purposing to have all the glory of the whole World alone, and that <hi>Adam</hi> might not challenge any jot thereof, therefore without his counsell, help, or consent, he would doe it while
<hi>Adam</hi> was fast asleep; Which must teach us this Lesson, That especially in this weighty matter of Wyving, when we see we want that holy help, we must not think by our own policie and strength to get us one meet and good for us, but rather by prayer commend that work to Gods care and providence, who then (no doubt) will bring that work to passe which shall be most fit and meet for us, while we are fast asleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>If any ask, <hi>Why she was taken out of his side, which is the middle part of mans body, and not out of his head or foot?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note>This answer may stand with good reason, That she was not taken out of his head or shoulder <hi>Ne insolesceret foemina,</hi> that is, lest affecting a superiority over the Man she should take upon her arrogancie to be the top of his head or to ride over his shoulders: If any doe so, let them know, that it is not the Womans part nor place to exalt herself so high. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, God of purpose would not have her taken out of the foot, <hi>Ne eam homo sub pedibus contereret,</hi> &amp; make her too much an underling as scarce good enough to wash his feet: If any so use their wives, let them know, God made them not to so base and contemptible offices, but would have good and vertuous women to be set next themselves as their matches in all dutie and love; for God hath made her of his side that she might be <hi>collateralis,</hi> that is, be thought worthy to stand, and sit, and lye by his side; therefore it is said, <hi>that the Kings spouse being brought to him was set on his right hand, Psal.</hi> 45. 9. And indeed if women did consider their estate, they would know it to be farre better and safer for them (being the weaker vessell) to shrowd themselves under their husbands arms for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as their protector, than to sit above his shoulder as Lord and superior over him. Again, Women may see that God made them
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62585:136"/>of a rib, which is a strong bone, that they might be a means and prop to their weaknesse, to uphold and be a stay to them and their estate, and not a weakning and decayiug of their estates and strength, as many doe. And as they learn this of the nature of their matter, so they must learn to avoid one thing, which is the bone of which they were made, namely, they must not be crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and

<hi>putredo in ossibus, and a grief to their heart.</hi> Now we may consider that of this matter God made him not many wives, not two wives, yea not more than only one, which condemneth <hi>

                  </hi> for many reasons and respects: for many inconveniences and griefs come to the man and the family, where more than one hath been, it was the cause &amp; occasion of strife and brawls, as we may see in the example of
<hi>Elkana</hi> his two wives 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 5. 7. 8. for they did not only vexe one another, but both of them were a vexation to him. The like example we have in <hi>Sara</hi> and <hi>Agar,</hi> so ill did they agree under one man, that one house was not able to hold them; wherefore Gods ordinance is (who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is best for us) that one man shall have but one only wife.</p>
               <p>A word now of the supplement; for it is said that God taking out a rib made a wound, and healed it up again, and made flesh to be the supplement thereof: By which we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> becanse Woman is the weaker vessel, therefore God would have her to have some of the Mans strength, and lest the man should be too strong and rigorous, he hath imparted some of the Womans weaknesse to him: Which must teach man and wife to know that God hath made them so that they should bear one with anothers infirmities. And there is nothing which doth more make void the bond of love and unity, which God hath so strongly confirmed, between man and wife, as this one thing, that the one doth not bear with the others infirmities and imperfections.</p>

To falsifie and disprove which saying, ye shall hear
<hi>Rebecca</hi> say, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 46. <hi>Taedet animam meam vitae meae:</hi> And the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that she hath a soul as well as Man, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 46. saying <hi>Magnificat anima mea,</hi> &amp;c.

Touching the body of the Woman, we must know, that though God might truly have been called the Creator of Woman, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet <hi>Moses</hi> chooseth rather to call him the builder of Woman, which stile and title is also given to God in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 4. who is said
<hi>to frame and build all things;</hi> and the reason why he altereth the phrase is, because the word <hi>Create</hi> signifieth the making a thing of nothing; but she was made of something, namely of his rib. And also God useth this phrase, comparing himself to a Carpenter and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to an house, because he did purpose to make Woman, as it were, his storehouse, in which he had layed up all the race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, which should thereafter come out of her wombe to replenish the Earth, <hi>for she was the rock and vault out of which we were digged, Esay</hi> 51. 1. Out of this house, here builded, came all Men and Women whatsoever, both fair &amp; foul, strong and weak, rich and poor,
<hi>Regum turraes pauperum tabernae;</hi> yea out of this house came all the houses and Families of the World, both <hi>Domus Jacobi,</hi> that is Gods house and his Church, and <hi>Domus Judeae,</hi> that is the Kings house and the Families of all Common-wealths. When this was builded God laid in her the foundation and hope of all these buildings both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publique; therefore God in the Scriptures of Kingdoms and Common-wealths, doth compare them to Women <hi>Ezech.</hi> 23. 4.

<hi>Adduxit</hi> is understood Gods <hi>conjunxit,</hi> his coupling and joyning them together in marriage; for we see the woman first taketh God by the hand religiously, before she taketh <hi>Adam</hi> by the hand; for unless wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do first dutifully and devoutly resign themselves over into Gods hands, to be disposed and ruled at his will and pleasure, they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be joyned most holily in marriage, to the building up of their own house in the Common-wealth nor of Gods house in the Church; that is, if we doe dispose our selves at our own wills &amp; pleasures, being led to our choice, not by Gods hand our heavenly Father, and by his Deputies our Parents on earth, which now must bring and give us in marriage.

In which denomination he doth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and impart his own name unto her, and would have her to wear a part of his own name, by which she may be known to be his

                  </gap>, and continued amongst the children of <hi>Adam;</hi> yea, even amongst the heathen, whose saying was to them whom they vowed to make their wife, <hi>ubi ega sum Caius tu eris Caia,</hi> that is, thou shalt be intituled and endowed first with mine owne name: So we see that after the Wedding, in which the wife is brought and given to the man, her name is for ever eclipsed, as our Law saith, and she must shine by her husbands name; and the giving this name to her, doth not only argue a propriety and right in her, but also a sovereignty and power over her as her head, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is manifested in this, that she was not only made <hi>ex eo, sed propter eum:</hi> she was not only brought <hi>ad eum,</hi> but also had her name <hi>de eo,</hi> which four prepositions, <hi>propter, ad, ex, &amp; de</hi> are four strong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove her subjection. Again we see that
<hi>Adam</hi> giveth her not every name by which he was called: But his speciall and chiefest names is <hi>Ish,</hi> out of which the name
<hi>Ishah,</hi> which is woman. This his name <hi>Ish,</hi> is a name of dignitie and honour, which (as some say) is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the word
<hi>Jashah,</hi> which signifieth he is the Monarch and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ruler of all Gods Creatures: wherefore if <hi>Adam</hi> was preferred to this title of honour to be a King, then he will impart it to his wife, and make her as Queen and Empress with him.</p>
               <p>We may read in the Scripture this note of difference touching his names being diversly applied; for <hi>Ben Ish,</hi> which is <hi>filius hominis,</hi> is spoken in honor of those that are the best and excellent men. But <hi>Ben Adam,</hi> which is <hi>fillius Adam</hi> implieth the common and basest, for <hi>Adam</hi> is a name of humility, to put him in minde of the matter he was made of; but <hi>Ish</hi> is a name of nobility, to shew him Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in exalting him on earth. But we shall best conceive what <hi>Adam</hi> meant in naming her thus, by the reason which he rendred by calling her so,
<hi>Quia sumpta erat ex viro,</hi> which is, as if he had said, this is the cause why I would have her called so, because in this name all may see the wonderfull work of God in making her so: and that all may know I love thee as my self, therefore this shall be thy name.</p>
               <p>To conclude concerning this name, we must note that the woman hath threee names in the Scripture as well as man. The first is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall name in respect of the Sex, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 27. by which they are called male and female, which is given as he is the Stock, and she is the Storehouse of all mankinde. The second is <hi>Adams</hi> matter and <hi>Eves</hi> mold, which in him is the name of his, and in her is the name of her fruitfulness, that she is the mother of all living Creatures. The third is the honorable name given in marriage, which is <hi>Ish</hi> and <hi>Ishah</hi> man and woman, which signifieth the dignity to which God exalted them both. And this may suffice of their names:</p>

               <p>So that this is made a perpetuall Law, not for <hi>Adam</hi> only and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, but for all <hi>Adam's</hi> posterity in generall.</p>
               <p>For we see that it respecteth not so much <hi>Adam</hi> as us, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, because God doth not direct his speech in the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as saying, <hi>thou shalt,</hi> &amp;c.

17. <hi>That the Crowes of the Valley shall pull out their eyes,</hi> yet notwithstanding this bond of naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection being so great and strong, God saith, that he would have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried folks rather violate and break that, then break this bond where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with man and wife is united, and tied together, not that God would simply tollerate and alow any breach of duty between parents and children, but only in respect of cleaving to his wife, and the wife to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62585:140"/>her husband, wherefore we must know and beware that we doe not think it lawfull for us, being once married, so to forsake our parents which brought us forth, and bred us up, as to set light by them, and not to regard them as many unnaturall children doe under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, for to take away that savage and brutish disobedience, <hi>Quod hoc non extinguit affectionem sed ordinat,</hi> This freeth us not from our duty which Gods Law and the Law of nature bindeth us unto, but it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us how to dispose it aright, that is, how to cleave to our parents in duty as we

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and how to be united to our wives in love as we ought also: By this then appeareth that it is Gods will that the link of love between married folks, should exceed in strength and measure, if it be possible, even the naturall bond of love and affection that is between parents and their children; and there may be rendred suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reason why it ought so to be; first because his wife was made of the very true and reall flesh and bone indeed, but children doe come only of the seed of the fathers and blood of their mothers, so that it may truely be said that <hi>the wife is flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone,</hi> but their children are only flesh and bone of his seed and blood. Again children are only the fruit of their loyns which is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the heart than the wife which is of the ribs which is most neer and therefore most deer to the heart. Lastly, because men doe love their children <hi>tanquam aliquid sui,</hi> but they love their wives
<hi>tanquam semetipsum, Ephes.</hi> 5. 28. Seeing therefore self love is the greatest and most perfect love, we conclude also that that marriage love must be neerest and most like it, by the ordinance of God; for our use this doth seem to give us a caveat, touching the evill and shamefull divorce and separation of man and wife, which are too rife now a daies, for if so be that Gods knot of marriage, should be so surely knit, that it must not be broken, for our deer parents sake, but of the two, choose rather to forsake them; then no doubt it is not his will that for every sleight and trifling cause and occasion they should sue divorces, and forsake one another, for this is the divinity which our Saviour Christ doth gather out of this place, <hi>Mark</hi>
10. 4. And thus much of the first part.</p>
               <p>Now touching the other part of the position, we are to consider two points: first, the union and conjunction of their hearts in love, which is called their cleaving together: The other is the union and combination of their bodies, expressed in these words, they shall be both one flesh; the first is called of some <hi>conjunctio mentis,</hi> the other is <hi>copulatio carnis,</hi> both which are ordeined of God as holy and good, for the first we see that this unity of minde by unfeined love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is called
<hi>vinculum perfectionis, Colos.</hi> 3. 14. So that this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall love is the best glue to make them cleave together without se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
               <p>For so indeed this word signifieth glue, or a kinde of glueing and sodering together, wherefore as two things are by glue or soder united and made but one, so by love ought man and wife, which sheweth, <hi>amor conjugalis</hi> must be <hi>reciprocus,</hi> respecting and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:62585:140"/>hold of both sides alike as glue doth.</p>
               <p>There must be <hi>amare &amp; Redamare amorem impendere &amp; rependere,</hi> for if love be not mutuall, if it cleave fast but to one side, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live together as one, but needs must fall asunder as we may often see, and to make this glue hold fast for ever, it is requisite that it be tempered with the knowledge of God, that it may be a religious love, for carnall love is <hi>vinculum Ethnicorum;</hi> but godly love is <hi>vinculum Christianorum: Salomon</hi> cleaved to many wives, but because it was not in a holy and religious love, therefore they made him not cleave to God, but caused sinne to cleave fast to his soul: And thus much of the eternall cleaving together in affection.</p>
               <p>Now for the other which is carnall and externall, it is that combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which God saith, maketh two but one flesh, and that not only in that honourable estate of an undefiled bed, but also in that wicked and filthy conjunction of harlots, as it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. For they which converse with harlots are said to make themselves one with them.</p>
               <p>For marriage we may say in some sense, it is begun in the spirit and doth end in the flesh.</p>
               <p>This knot of carnall copulation, <hi>St. Paul</hi> expresseth in most godly and reverent terms, and so wisely, that sober eares cannot be offended thereat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 3.4. First, he calleth it due benevolence, due in regard of the right, which the one may lawfully challenge at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hands, benevolence, because it must be granted willingly with love and good will, for if one deny the other he saith in the 5. verse that it is a frauding of one anothers right; for which cause, he saith, that neither partie hath
<hi>potestatem sui corporis,</hi> but one hath right and interest in the other. Now of this union man and woman becommeth but one flesh, and, as it were, members of one anothers body, and not only so, but of this conjunction of them two cometh, by Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, one flesh, that is, the fruit of children, which proceedeth from them both, and so an unity of the the flesh in the body born, is the fruit of their two bodies so united, as <hi>Leah</hi> saith,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 20. is very effectuall to be another link of love, to binde man and wife more neer together, for which cause children are called
<hi>pignora amoris;</hi> This then (to conclude) is the cut-throat of polygamie and adultery, of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamie, because God saith, <hi>they two shall be one flesh;</hi> therefore more than two in the conjunction is intollerable; of adultery it is the overthrow, because he will have two by this combination to be but one body, wherefore it is an abhomination and monster of nature, for one man to be two bodies, for he which joyneth himself to a harlot, thereby made one body with her, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. And here we see that he is also one body with his wife, and so Gods ordinance is perverted, who would have two but one body, but these leachers doe make their one bodies become two.</p>

But above these duties in <hi>adduxit Deus</hi> is a religious institution by God, and a possessing of their bodies in sanctitie and holinesse of life, <hi>not being stained with filthinesse, vain je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting or wantonnesse, which are things uncomly, Ephes.</hi> 5. 4.

               <p>As for the speciall institution of Marriage here, in regard of the time and place, It was instituted in time of Innocencie in Paradise; which state of Marriage is not only a thing tolerable, or a thing alowable, as a thing indifferent, or commendable in some alone; but <hi>Marriage is honourable among all persons, all degrees,</hi> as it is in the 13. <hi>Hebrews</hi> 4. according to that in the Psalme, <hi>Man being in honour,</hi> which time of honour was in time of Innocencie.
<note place="margin">7. Honors of marriage.</note>Now there are seven honors of Marriage,
<note place="margin">1. Necessity.</note>The first is of necessitie; for that since <hi>Adams</hi> fall the disease of incontinencie is common to all sorts of men; therefore Marriage is offered to all sorts of men without respect.

<note place="margin">6 Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note>The sixth honor which maketh Marriage most hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, is the presence and presidence of God himself, by his <hi>dixit</hi> in the 18. verse, <hi>God said it is not good that man should be alone;</hi> and by his <hi>adduxit</hi> he brought her to the Man; and by his <hi>conjunxit, whom God hath joyned;</hi> and by Gods

               <p>Thirdly, in respect of the persons of <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve,</hi> it was good for <hi>Adam</hi> to have a wife; it is permitted to Bishops to have one wife, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. the Apostles themselves had wives, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 5. There were never such Saints in the world, as were Saint <hi>Adam,</hi> and Saint <hi>Eve</hi> in the estate of their innocencie &amp; integrity, yet were they married. There are none, of what degree soever, that are so holy, but by the example of
<hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eve,</hi> they may take upon them this estate of marriage, <hi>which is honorable among all men:</hi> it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable in all, it is not intollerable in some. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. this may be restrained in some sorts of men, not to be condemned in any; for Marriage, <hi>which is honourable in all men,</hi> dishonoureth no man. Thus much for the framing of our Judgments.</p>
               <p>Now of the practise, which we will divide into the precedents before Marriage, the duties in Marriage, and the dissolution of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>

Why? Not only because she was beautifull, or because she might be an help unto him in his age, but because all the Citie knew that she was a virtuous woman, <hi>Ruth</hi> 3. 11. for
<hi>he knew that favour is deceitfull, and beauty is vanitie, Mulier autem ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Dominum ipsa laudabitur,</hi> as it is in <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 30. where a great Dowrie, or a womans beautie is the glue of this bond, there the glue will goe asunder, if wealth decay and beauty perish; <hi>and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times riches take the wings of an Eagle and flie away:</hi> It is virtue that maketh man and wife cleave faster together.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Faithfulnesse and Love.</note>The general duties which doe concern Man as well as Woman, and Woman as well as Man, which doe concern them both, are two, Faithfulnesse and Love. Which two we must alienate from all other Women, and appropriate them only to our Wives. <hi>The heart of the husband trusteth in a faithfull wife, Proverbs</hi> 31. 11.
<hi>see</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 4, and 5. <hi>The one hath power over the others body: Marriage is honourable, and the bed undefiled; but Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge, Hebr.</hi> 13. 4. Faithfullnesse is promised in the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Marriage; <hi>but the faithlesse Woman forsaketh the guide of her youth</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:62585:144"/>
                  <hi>and forgetteth the Covenant of her God, Prov.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>the paths of a strange Woman are movable, Proverbs</hi> 5. 6. there is no faith to be reposed in such a Woman.</p>
               <p>The other dutie is Love: For that Woman was taken out of mans side, she was his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> closse to his heart, which is the seat of love. Man must love her as his part; and she must also love him, for that he was wounded mortally for her sake, and had been in great danger of his life, had he not had so excellent a Physition and Surgeon to close up his side again. <hi>Man is the Image and glory of God, Woman is the glorie of Man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7. And again, <hi>A vertuous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is the crown of her Husband, Proverbs</hi> 12. 4. There is a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their name and of their nature, which will move mutuall love, which procureth inward comforting and outward cherishing; <hi>for no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, Ephesians</hi> 5.
29. <hi>The Woman must be subject to the Man, and the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band must give honour to the Wife, as to the weaker Vessel,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 7. The man is as the stock, the woman as the branch; the wife must be loving; <hi>for a contentious and angry Wife is condemned, Proverbs</hi> 21. 17. And <hi>Husbands must love their Wives, and not be bitter unto them, Colos.</hi> 3. 19. This mutuall love must be above the love to the Parents or to the Children, there was a great regard in times past not to abuse anothers Concubine, 2
<hi>Sam,</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p>In several, there are in them two other Duties: In the man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and wise government; there is, I say, in the husband direction, and there must be in the woman subjection, to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his direction. And here I am to admonish women of seven things, to make them to honor their husbands. First, they must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that <hi>Adam was formed first, and then Eve,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Man was not created for the Womans sake, but Woman for the Mans sake,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 9. Besides he was wounded that she might be made. She was taken out of him. She was brought unto him. She was made to help him. She received her name of his name; his name was <hi>Ish,</hi> her name <hi>Ishah:</hi> She had in her name a letter of five in number lesse than man, to shew she was but a diminutive: All these doe imply womans subjection.</p>
               <p>There are two other Duties several, of the man and wife: <hi>The Man must protect his Wife in danger, chap.</hi> 20. 11. Providing is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the man, to provide for his houshold and family, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. And the woman is to preserve and enlarge that her husband hath provided; the domesticall duty of preserving the house and hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold pertaineth to her, as it is in <hi>Proverbs</hi> 31. 21. She should be of the property of the Snail, still at home; <hi>but a foolish Woman is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, Proverbs</hi> 9. 13. The house in holy Scripture is taken for the Children, whom she must bear and bring up in the fear of God; <hi>The Wife through bearing of Children shall be saved,</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. The house is taken for the Servants, whom we must govern well: And the house is taken for the implements, which she must order and enlarge. She must be not as Ivie, which cleavth to the tree,<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62585:145"/>and is not profitable, though green;
<hi>but as the fruitfull Vine on the sides of thine house, she shall bear Children like to the Olive plants, round about thy table, Psalme</hi> 128.

There were certain Cynical Philosophers, and notable Hereticks, called Adamites, that went naked; but at length they were weary of their opinion, they were not able long to continue naked, and were at last ashamed of their nakednesse.

<hi>Adams</hi> Innocencie was when the word of God was above all, when mans reason was subject to Gods word, when his will was obedient to his reason, when his concupiscence to his will, and when his flesh was subject to his concupiscence; so all in Man was straight and right, he was upright within and without; his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was obedient, his will was not perverse, his concupiscence was chaste; the nakednesse of the body corrupted not the soul; it was original righteousnesse that was the complexion of Mans soul; when Man was innocent, there was then no hindrance of good, nor any inclination to evill: All this while there was no shame, for there was nothing whereof man had cause to be ashamed: Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and uprightnesse brought forth chastity, chastity brought forth courage, and this it is that made them, though they were naked, not to be ashamed.</p>

24. in a word, the spouse of the Lamb Christ Jesus, whose wife is the Church,
<hi>she shall at the latter day be arrayed with pure fine linnen and shining, and the fine linnen is the righteousnesse of the Saints, Revel.</hi> 19. 8. The apparel that covered <hi>Adam</hi> was his innocencie and the robe of righteousnesse, <hi>melior est vestis Innocentia, quàm Purpura,</hi> Innocencie is better apparel than pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or scarlet, say the Fathers out of the first of <hi>Proverbs</hi> 31. 22. where <hi>Salomon,</hi> speaking of the wise woman, saith, <hi>that her family are cloathed in scarlet, and purple is her garment,</hi> that is the outward vesture. But in verse 25. he saith,
<hi>strength and honour is her cloathing,</hi> that is, say they, the inward decking of the soul, it is not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apparel that God regardeth, but as
<hi>Peter</hi> saith in his first Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>If the hid man of the heart be uncorrupt with a meek and quiet spirit before God, it is a thing much set by.</hi> Purple and scarlet are the chief colours, and most esteemed of by men, yet, yet they are the colours of shame and confusion. Man in his Innocencie was in honor, innocencie and righteousnesse were then his cloathing; but when Man obeyed Sathan and disobeyed God, he put on the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels livery, which was sinne and shame, according to that in <hi>Psalme</hi> 132.
18. God saith, <hi>He will cloath his enemies with shame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Homo spoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atus honore, indutus pudore,</hi> after mans fall he was spoyled of his honor and wrapped in a few clouts to cover his shame: this was his change, from honor to misery.</p>
               <p>We must now labour by all means, to recover this first innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and seeing that we are become wretched and miserable, poor and naked, we must follow the counsell of the Angel in <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 18.
<hi>We must buy of Christ the white rayment, that we may be cloathed, and that our filthie nakednesse should not appear: We must put off the old man with his works, Coloss.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>And we must put on the new man, which is Christ, who is renued in knowledge after the Image of him that created him. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> the younger sonne, must put on the cloaths of his elder brother
<hi>Esau, chap.</hi> 27. 15. And we must put on, say the Fathers upon that place, the apparel of righteousnesse of our elder brother Christ, eldest sonne to God: the faithfull are called <hi>the Children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Galath.</hi> 3.
7. But we by the faith we have in Christ Jesus, hope to become the Children of God, and heirs of everlasting life; as in the Gospel it is said, <hi>that his wounds doe heal us;</hi> so may it as well be said, that his nakednesse must cover our nakednesse: by his passion he washeth away our sinnes; he dyed us with his purple blood; he<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62585:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>dyed an Innocent that we by his death might be unblamable; his apparel is red, and his garments like him that treadeth the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse; <hi>it was he alone that trod the Wine-presse, and all his rayment shall be stained, Esay</hi> 63. 3. It was the purple of his blood that dyed us again in original righteousnesse: the souldiers when they had cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him, took off his garments, so that he hung naked upon the crosse, <hi>John</hi> 19. 23. You see by the 12. to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> 2.
<hi>that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the crosse and despised the shame,</hi> to deliver us from shame and eternall punishment: So that we must repose our selves in him, and not be ashamed of him; <hi>for who so shall be ashamed of Christ, Christ shall be ashamed of him, when he shall come in his glorie, Luke</hi> 9. 26. But all our glory and rejoycing must be in the dear and only begotten sonne of God,
<hi>in whom we have redemption through his blood, that is, the forgivenesse of sinnes, who is the image of the invisible God, the first born of every Creature, by whom, and for whom all things were created,</hi> 1
<hi>Coloss.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>We must put off the old man and put on the new;</hi> and if we be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled with Christs righteousnesse, we shall not be ashamed: We must not cloath our selves with our own works and our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, which is corruption and shame; but we must cloath our nakednesse with the nakednesse of Christ <hi>the immaculate Lamb.</hi> In a word his wounds must heal us, his nakednesse must be our cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, his shame must be our glorie, his death must be the means to attain our life. Then we shall hunger no more nor thirst no more, we shall be impassible of cold and of heat, <hi>and the Lamb which is in the middest of the faithfull shall govern them, and lead them unto the lively fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes, Revel.</hi> 7. 17. And if we be washed with his blood, we shall be whiter than the snow; then shall we be cloathed with innocencie by him, <hi>our corrupt bodies shall put on incorruption; and after the mortality of this our body we shall be cloathed with immortality of body and soul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4, &amp;c.

Now, lest any of us comparing our estate with <hi>Adams,</hi> and finding so great an alteration and difference between him and us; because he was holy, we corrupt with sinne; he was happy and blessed having all things, wanting nothing which might increase his happiness, we miserable, subject to all calamities and distresses which may encrease our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; he without shame or sorrow, we confounded with them both: Therefore lest we should enquire how this Change and Alteration came to our natures, the Prophet in this Chapter will shew it us, that we may be out of doubt.</p>
                  <p>As therefore we have had hitherto, the building, beautifying, and perfecting the Frame of all the world and of all the works of God: So now we shall see the ruine and lamentable overthrow of all, which Saran by sinne brought unto all. For whatsoever God hath done in the great world in generall, as it is set down in the first Chapter, or whatsoever we have seen excellent and glorious in the little world, which is in the state of man, described in the second Chapter: All that shall we see in this Chapter to be overthrown by the work and malice of the Devill.</p>
                  <p>At the sight and consideration of which Tragedy, as <hi>St. Augustine</hi> saith, all the Creatures, especially mankinde, ought with sighs and groanes to dissolve themselves into teares, to think of our and their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and irrecoverable confusion, were it not for this which is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto it, namely, the hope of the seed of the woman, promised to come at the fulness of time, to restore all things which were lost in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, and to bring us a more excellent Paradise than that ever was.</p>

                     <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 2. 17. that is, <hi>what time soever he should sinne, and break the Commandement of God, he should die;</hi> that is, have all the Messengers and Ministers of death ferzing upon him, untill <hi>death it self, the reward of sinne,</hi> should take hold on him; which first part of the Chapter we shall divide as
<hi>St. Paul</hi> doth teach us <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. into two parts, the first he calleth <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum,</hi> the other <hi>peccati obsonium,</hi> that is, into the cause and nature of sinne, and into the effect and punishment which followeth it: Concerning the transgression, he setteth down first the temptation of sin, in the first 5. verses; then the preparation which is the sinne it self, in the 6. verse; then followeth the stipend and hier of sinne from that verse unto the 15. verse: In which verse then the prophet sheweth that God in justice remembred mercie; and as <hi>St. James</hi> saith, caused his mercy to triumph over justice in the promised seed, without which remedy
<hi>Adams</hi> sinne had been incurable, and his case and our condition had been most desperate; whereas by this means, as <hi>St. Augustine</hi> saith, the Devills envy is <hi>foelix invidia,</hi> and <hi>Adams</hi> sinne is
<hi>foelix culpa,</hi> that is, falleth out to the greater glorie of all the elect sonnes of God.</p>
                  <p>Now more particularly we are led to consider two things in the temptation; first of all the persons, both agent and patient, and then the allurements and inticements thereof: The chief in this temptation was the Devill and the Woman, and then in regard of consent, <hi>Adam</hi> himself grew accessory and guilty thereof, so that there were three causes of sinne: The chiefest Author of it was the Devill; the next is <hi>Eve</hi> the yeelder to him; the third was <hi>Adam,</hi> the consenter to them both.</p>
                  <p>Serpents we know speak not, for they were not made to reason and dispute, therefore we must needs understand another high person besides he Serpent, which spake in him, and used him as his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and means to effect this evil devise.</p>
                  <p>And in this respect, the Devill is called <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 9.
<hi>the old Serpent</hi> as his name appellative, by which he was once called, and <hi>Satanas Revel.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

2. as his proper name, by which his

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and malicious nature is made known.</p>
                  <p>As therefore the Devill craftily and closely did put into
<hi>Judas</hi> head and heart by his suggestion, how to seek Christs fall and death <hi>John</hi> 13. 2. so doth he as sly lie put into the Serpents mouth this temptation, by which he might betray the first <hi>Adam</hi> and bring him to death; and therefore as Christ truly, though not properly, called <hi>Judas Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> because he saw the Devill used him as his Instrument; So by the same right and reason may we call the Serpent the Devill, because it was he in this Serpent who did bring this thing to pass.</p>
                  <p>If any doe aske why <hi>Moses</hi> did not make mention of the Devil in all this Chapter? we may say, that it was <hi>Moses</hi> purpose to perform the office and duty of a Historiographer, which is only to make a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:62585:152"/>plain and true report of the outward accident, and thing which was sensibly done, leaving the hidden and secret meaning and true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of those things which are mysticall, unto his Interpreters and Expositors: For to this end, <hi>Moses</hi> had some alwaies in Gods Church, which did not only read the letter and words of his writings, but also expound the true meaning thereof; and what Expositor is there, but by the consequence of this story, and by conference of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, can otherwise understand this then of the Devill. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ telleth us <hi>that the Devill was a lyer and murtherer from the beginning. John</hi> 8. 44. that is, he is the primitive and principall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all untruth and evill, therefore is he called that evill <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 19. <hi>and the deceiver of mankinde, Revel.</hi> 12. 9. and therefore <hi>Moses</hi> doth first deal with this evill one, and setteth him down as the chief author of this evill, under the form and name of a Serpent. Touching him therefore, we must know as I told you
<hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 1. that when God is said to make the hoast of heavenly Creatures, that then also he made the Angells, as <hi>David</hi> saith
<hi>Psalme</hi> 148. 2. <hi>which Angells God made

6. <hi>but fell away from their holy and blessed estate in which they mere made, and so there they became evill Angels reserved in chains to everlasting fur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this fall of Angells, <hi>Job</hi> seemeth to have knowledge <hi>Job</hi> 4. 18.

He then being fallen, became not only an adversary to God, which cast him off for ever, but also an envious enemie to mankinde; for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to wreack his mal ceagainst God, he maliciously invented and attempted all the mischief and evill he could against man, which was the Image of God, and the only Creature on whom God had set his heart and delight to doe him good: For as they which love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot but love and shew kindness to his Children, which are deerest to him, as we see in <hi>Davids</hi> example.

                  <p>THe persons which concurred in this temptation I shewed were of two sorts, first the Tempter, and then the Tempted; The persons tempting are of two sorts, the one plainly expressed by name to be the Serpent, the other necessarily implied, and to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, namely, <hi>the old Serpent, which is called the Devill, and Satan, the destroyer and deceiver of mankinde, Rev.</hi> 12. 9. so that we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in this place, that <hi>Satanus hic est personatus, &amp; Serpens est inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus,</hi> the Devill is in the shape of a Serpent, and the Serpent is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with the Devill; for we know that Serpents cannot speak and reason, therefore it must needs be somewhat in him: Herein then we see the disposition of evill and damnable Spirits, who being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into miserie, doe seek to draw all others into the same calamity in the which they are wrapped and plunged, for the Devill will not only
<hi>perire,</hi> but also <hi>perdere,</hi> and therefore, as we see doth use all forcible means to bring it to pass.</p>
                  <p>But because he knew that he should never bring about the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of man, so long as man should be united and tied fast to God in love and duty, obeying his will; therefore first of all he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth most subtilly to untie the knot, by dissolving the Law and Commandement of God, through the transgression of man: and thus much of the chief actor in this temptation, which is the Devill.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the second person, which is the means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument which he used for this purpose, namely, the Serpent.</p>
                  <p>Touching which, we shall see that the ancient Philosophers and wise men of the world may seem to have had some knowledg, for they call the evill Spirit the Serpentine Devill, and a hellish Fury in the form and shape of a Serpent, as if they had had some notice that he made choice of this Creature, especially above other, to doe the greatest mischiefto man.</p>
                  <p>In considering of the entrance of the Devill, possessing the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, we must needs know, that if the Devill will needs tempt <hi>Adam</hi> unto evill, then he must of necessity doe it either with some inward suggestion or motion within, or else by some externall temptation and allurement without: But the Devill knew that <hi>Adam</hi> then, in that estate of innocency had no evill concupiscence or corruption within, by which he might fasten any ill motion or suggestion, for his lust and affections were not as tinder, that is, were not apt to take any spark of the Devills temptations, as ours are, for we are not only as tinder very prone to take evill; but as Gun-powder, which with every spark is wholy enflamed, and violently is carried away with
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:62585:153"/>the desire of evill, his soul was not yet poysoned, with the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinne as ours are, therefore he saw that then there was no time nor place, to assault him with inward temptations or perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to make him doe evill, and therefore useth some sensible and ex, ternall allurements to besiege him without.</p>
                  <p>To this end therefore, he must needs appear in some visible and sensible shape and resemblance, and that must either be in some form and shape suteable &amp; agreeable to <hi>Adams</hi> nature, or else in some other apparition and form unlike him, if he had appeared in some ugly and loathsome shape like to himself, he knew that though he could not be terrified with fear (being innocent) and therefore without fear, yet <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> would have contemned such an instrument, and not have suffered him to have set abroach his assaults, for which cause his policy and devise was, to cover himself with a fairer mask and vizard, that he may seem better and more beautifull, then he was indeed.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Resp.</note>I answer, that no doubt his will was good, for he would have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned himself into an Angell of light, or have put on him the shape of a grave and sage Prophet, as he did in deceiving
<hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 13. But it must not be as the Devill will have it, but as it pleaseth God to appoint and permit him: And the fathers doe think that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God of set purpose, did allot him this creature and restrain him all other, for these two respects: first, thereby to punish the pride and the ambitious nature of the Devill, that he might see and all the world perceive, to what this sinne of pride had brought him, because he which a little before was so vainglorious as to presume to exalt him in Gods throne and be as God, is now cast down in most vile and miserable sort, basely and contemptibly crawling upon the ground and being as the abject and most hated worm on the earth: that so all men might see and consider what pride and ambitious vain glory will bring them unto, but the Devills malice and envy towards man, being now greater than his pride was before, therefore it is no matter how vile and base the instrument and means be, so it will serve his turn, he will refuse nothing no not the Serpent, if by his means he might bring man to the same condemnation and wrath, in which he is already plunged.</p>
                  <p>The other respect, (they think) was that the temptation of Satan might be more easie for <hi>Adam</hi> to resist and withstand, for who would not think it most easie for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> being so wise and excellent, and furnished with all graces of Gods spirit, to espie and contemn such ill counsell, which would have him withdraw his allegiance and duty to God his gracious Creator, especially being solicited thereto, by so vile, and base a creature as a Serpent is? Who would not think it impossible that a weak worm should prevaile agaist <hi>Adam</hi> in the prime and excellency of his strength. Again the very name of the Serpent, which
<hi>Adam</hi> according to his wisdome gave unto him, might have given him a caveat and warning to sulpect the fly

                  <p>Surely all this was for his advantage and ease indeed, but seeing he yeelded cowardly to the Devill, notwithstanding all these helps, therefore they doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and more immeasurably sinfull before God and man.</p>
                  <p>Now it is said, that the Devill did possesse and enter into the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, as being well content to try, whether this instrument and means would serve his turn, and this is not a thing any whit strange or incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, but very usually seen and often heard, that the Devill can and hath really possessed and dwelt in the bodies of earthly creatures, as <hi>he entred into man, Luke</hi> 11. 24 <hi>Into Swyne, Luke</hi> 8. 33. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 16. All which doe make this matter plain and easie to believe.</p>
                  <p>But for the other point of the Devills power, to make a dumb creature to speak, this hath been a stumbling block at which Athiests and carnall men, led by corrupt and sensuall reason have stumbled and fell down into flat infidelity, saying they would never believe it, but we must not be moved with the infidelity of such: for the truth of Gods word shall stand undoubted and true, in despite of them which resist it. One father shewing the truth of this place, saith thus, what will you not believe, that the Devill can speak in a Serpent, nor make a Serpent to speak, because it is against his nature to speak, will ye think that which is strange in reason, to be impossible to the Devill; God permitting him to doe it? Then (saith he) if ye will believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that for which a reason may be yeelded, give me a reason of the nether Jaw or Chap, which only having a small little sinew as a thread to hold it up, is notwithstanding (in some) of such strength as to be able to bite in sunder a ten-penny nail, tell me (saith he) how the Liver and Stomack having in them such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Again (saith he) are there not in all ages of the world, many strange and wonderfull things seen and heard of, which are most true, of which no reason at all can be gathered, why then should this thing seem incredible and so strange, as that ye should deny ever it was done. And thus much of his answer to their incredulous objection.</p>

<hi>Eve</hi> by little and little, the love and delight she had in the word of God. To which end he craftily maketh his first <hi>Dixit,</hi> to be a speech of question or interrogation, asking whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God indeed and in good earnest ever said so, and from thence he proceedeth unto <hi>nequaquam moriemini,</hi> which is a positive speech of presumption, that though they break that Law, yet they should not die. In the first he is the interogative Devill, but at last he is the negative Devill, not only doubting, but denying
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. A Serpent hath a double tongue, under one is the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is doubtfullness, under the other is the poyson of Aspes, which is open unbeliese.</p>
                  <p>The first speech <hi>dixítne</hi> is called <hi>sibilus Serpentis,</hi> but his last speech in the 5. verse is <hi>rugitus Leonis,</hi> in which he bewraieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at the full, of which two, the first is but introduction to the other mischief insuing.</p>
                  <p>For this is not the least policy of the Devill, not to set upon her bluntly, But like a Serpent slily and slowly to creep in her by little and little, untill he hath espied some vantage: Therefore his order is, to bring her from questioning in talk, to a doubt in opinion, and from that, to an error in judgement, and so at last, to a corrupt action in practise; and to corrupt her minde within, first he useth this order, to tickle her eares with curiosity, and by that, to cause her to have a giddyness and swimming in the brain, by fantasticall imaginations and surmizes, and then to make her secure and careless of the truth, and so at last maketh her somewhat inclineable to error and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                  <p>Now let us come to the particular word of God, which the Devill in his dialogisme doth mean to intreat of, which we see is that which is set down <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 16. 17. In propounding of which, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how craftily and corruptly he dealeth with the sacred word of God, to make it the better serve his turn in the temptation, for he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth off all that might make against him, and instead of that, putteth in by addition more than ever God spake, that so it may be the fitter for his purpose; he leaveth out first both all that went before and that which is after the Commandement, that is, he keepeth from her the consideration of Gods love and liberality, which is in the
16. verse, which was set to urge and induce them to willing obedience, and also he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> off the consideration of Gods severe judgements, which was set after to keep them by fear from disobedience</p>
                  <p>If we shall compare this also with that originall in the 16. and 17. verses before, we shall see how he depraveth and corrupteth the text; for whereas it is said <hi>precipit Jehova:</hi> the Devill doth extenuate it, and saith <hi>dixit Deus. q.d.</hi> If he did say it, he did but speak it by way of talk as if he would not urge it for any matter of weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Thus we see the Devills subtilty and sophistrie in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:62585:155"/>and the Devills Rhetorick in propounding this question; the end of all which, is either to make them doubt, or at least to set light by the commandement of God.</p>
                  <p>Though he seemeth to give her good counsell and to advise her as a friend, to consider of this thing more seriously, for the bettering her estate, yet his intent is at least to leave a scruple in her minde.</p>
                  <p>The chiefest poison that is hid in this dialogisme, is in the interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation <hi>cur,</hi> or <hi>quare,</hi> or as some will have it,
<hi>ne,</hi> by which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth whether it be so indeed, said so: It is scarce credible that God, which maketh shew of favouring you, should so hardly deal with you, as to impose so hard a Law as this is: and withall, this his speech is so cunningly devised, that it enforceth by way of insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a doubt and diffidence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> her thus,
<hi>q.d.</hi> Surely I for my part can hardly be induced to beleeve, that God would enjoyn you such a Law; I see no reason why it should be so: By all which we see how he teacherh and bringeth her on to doubt and waver.</p>
                  <p>Last of all it is a flattering and cogging kinde of speech
<hi>q.d.</hi> Though I may erre and be deceived, being your poorest and simplest Servant, yet you my Ruler whom God hath made wise as an Angell to judge uprightly of all things, may happily conceive more of this matter than I can.</p>
                  <p>And withall it is a kinde of cunning, to curry and keep in favour with her whatsoever effect the temptation should take; for if she should have misliked of his speech, he could have excused himself thus; alas I made but a bare motion, I neither affirmed it, nor durst deny it, but according to my simplicity asked the question, and therefore I trust you will have me excused.</p>

                        </gap>, 1591.</note>WE have seen before what the Devils Rhetorick and Sophistry is in his deceivable Dialogues, both to bring a wavering doubt into her minde, and at last to bring Gods holy word in discredit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; all which vile and blasphemous things, if the Devill had said to <hi>Adam,</hi> no doubt, he would have dealt wisely as a Serpent with this wyly and wicked Serpent; for he would have either stopped his eares; and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred to hear the deceitfull words of this inchanting charm, or else he would have shaked him off with <hi>apage</hi> as Christ did,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 10. and said <hi>avant Satan</hi> get thee hence, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And so it may be thought to have been the greatest wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome either to give him no eare or no answer, or else a sharp check or reproof for these wicked tempting words. This we may conjecture that the Man would or might have done: but let<pb n="258" facs="tcp:62585:156"/>us see what the Woman answered unto him in this verse.</p>
                  <p>In which we have two things to consider before we come to the effect of her answer: First we gather that in this estate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, the Woman was not afraid of the Serpent, but without fear durst see a Serpent approach to her, and speak unto him; for as all things were subject to mankind as their Lord and Sovereign, so <hi>Adam,</hi> as we have heard,
<hi>Genesis</hi> 2. 23. made <hi>Eve</hi> Mistriss and Lady to rule with him; and therefore all Creatures, as yet, stood in a reverend awe of them, and they were without any fear of them at all; for fear came into our nature with sinne, but as yet, there was no sinne, and therefore no fear: Again, as yet there was no war proclaimed between the seed of the woman and the Serpent, and therefore no cause why they should fear one another. The other thing is, that as she was not moved at the sight of the Serpent, so no more was she astonished to hear the Serpent speak; she knew no doubt that it was not naturall to Serpents so to speak, but she knew not, or at least considered not well, who it was that spoke in him; What then, was there ignorance in <hi>Eve</hi> in the state of Innocency? I answer, that no doubt there was both in <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve</hi> the ignorance which is called <hi>Nescientia,</hi> but not that which is properly termed <hi>Ignorantia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The difference between Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Nescience.</note>for this is the difference between these two:
<hi>Ignorantia</hi> is a not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such things which we are bound and ought necessarily to know, and this kinde we say was not in them, for it is an evill imperfection in whomsoever it is, because as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in
19. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. <hi>without this knowledge which is absolutely necessary, the soule of man is not good;</hi> therefore we hold that they had given them a full and perfect measure of knowledg of Gods will, so farre forth as it necessarily pertained unto them; but as for the other kind which deserveth not the name of Ignorance but Nescience, it is a not knowing of things needlesse and impertinent to our duty, that is, of superfluous and curious points which belong not to us; and this is that holy and godly Ignorance which is said to bee even in the Angels of heaven, and in the Son of God, (as he is man) 24.
<hi>Matt.</hi> 36. and of such things Christ saith to his disciples,
<hi>vestrum non est haec scire,</hi> 1. <hi>Acts.</hi> 7. Therefore this is no sinne or defect in them, though we grant it to be in them; yea it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well agreeth with the holy estate of innocency not to know need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse points of curious knowledg. But now to the answer, In which wee may observe divers steppes and degrees by which shee descended to him untill at last shee came even to him in opinion and consented to him.</p>
                  <p>And the first descent is because shee, being a woman and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the weaker, would notwithstanding (without the helpe and counsell of her husband) take upon her to dispute and reason with the devill, which is most deceitfull, for if she had given no answere, the devill should have had no advantage, but by her answer to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, she gave him som holdfast by which his temptation might som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what fasten on her; It had beene her wisest course to have stopped her eares, and not to have vouchsafed him the hearing, but if shee would<pb n="259" facs="tcp:62585:156"/>needs hear the Serpents talk, <hi>yet she might have set a watch before the door of her lips, Psal.</hi> 141. 3. and so condemned his speech as not worthy the answering. <hi>Si enim aut non audiverat aut nil dixerat</hi> (saith one) <hi>bene esset,</hi> but seeing she must needs fit him an answer, she should have done well to fetch an answer from her Husband, and to say I will goe to him which heard God speak that thing which you doubt of, he can better answer and resolve you in this point than I can; for if <hi>Paul</hi> would not permit a Woman to speak in the Church, but to be silent, then much less would he suffer Women to dispute and keep Probleme with the Devill; for their duty is to learn of their Husband at home, if they doubt; but she (according to the nature of Women) will not answer <hi>per aliam:</hi> they think themselves able to answer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and therefore let us see the tenor and contents of her answer, which we see is a rehearsall and repetition of Gods Commandement, <hi>Genesis</hi> 2. 16. 17. but yet so faintly and coldly set down, that the Devill might easily perceive that his temptation had begun to corrupt her minde; for, first in that she is able to say Gods Commandement without book: the Devill took this hold against her, that she did not sinne upon ignorance but wilfully against her knowledge, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that she did it presumptuosly which augmenteth her sinne, that so he may well say to her, <hi>ex ore tuo te judicabo.</hi> If we look into the particulars of her answer, we shall see it stand upon two points; the first is Gods graunt, the 2. verse; the other is Gods restraint, the 3. verse; by both which we may see that <hi>Eve</hi> simply and plainly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the Serpent as her friend in all the whole will and counsell of God: first she setteth down Gods goodness and liberality, and in expressing it, she doth extenuate and lessen the greatness thereof; but when she cometh to the restraint, she doth so amplifie and enlarge that, that the Devill might easily perceive she received the one not thankfully as she should, nor yet was well pleased, but murmured as much misliking the other, whereas she should have said God is not bound to us, either by duty or desert to give us any thing, yet of his gracious goodness he hath freely permitted us the use of the trees of the Garden, which are many in number, and in variety divers and choise, therefor he is not <hi>durus &amp; avarus pater,</hi> as thou wouldst have us to think, but he is <hi>bonus &amp; benignus,</hi> and therefore we will thankfully keep this easie Commandement. Thus the consideration of his bounty and free goodness should have been a prick to stirr her up to thankfull obedience, but her unthankfull minde which regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not his goodness, was a preparation to disobedience. Thus we see what her answer should have been to have stopped the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills mouth, but she did not so; therefore we are now to consider what she did say, and what answer she gave unto him.</p>

3. verse: for the first we have seen that the Woman had just occasion to amplifie Gods loving and most liberall dealing with them; but she clean contrary, being tickled by the Serpents speech, doth
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> it, as if it had been a matter of very small regard, and therefore in a word lightly passeth it over, making a very sleight and slender confession of Gods goodness, in so much as we may well say, that it is <hi>oratio magis querelae quam

                  <p>Now for the prohibition in the 3. verse, because she doth enlarge it, we must stand longer upon it; It

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:62585:157"/>as to say touch not, handle not; but only of the teeth and tongue, tast not, neither eat of it. To alter Gods word is a foul fault, but with an ill minde to add or detract from it, hath a grievous threatning and curse annexed to it, both by <hi>Moses</hi> the first, and <hi>St. John</hi> the last pen-man of the word of God: we see then, that this her addition is
<hi>signum displicentiae,</hi> which secret dislike of Gods Law, being cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mans hearts, doth at last make them break out into that outrage and rebellion against it, as to say, <hi>Psall.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Let us break his bonds, and cast away his yoke from us,</hi> which are called <hi>the Sonnes of Beliall,</hi> that is, such as willingly would be subject to no Law; it maketh men first in minde to esteem Gods word as a heavie burden, <hi>Jeremiab</hi>
13: 33: and it causeth men at last to say as they did, <hi>John</hi> 6. 60.
<hi>durus hic Sermo est quis ferat?</hi> As therefore that is true which
<hi>St. John</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Qui deum diligunt iis man data ej us non sunt gravia;</hi> so <hi>è contra</hi> we may inferre this generall rule <hi>Cui displicet praeceptum ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravat illud,</hi> for want of will doth make <hi>Verbum veritatis esse Jugum Servitutis,</hi> and so with offence, the wicked ones of the world doe cast it from them.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the punishment, of which we say, that as we ought to amplifie Gods goodness and liberality, to stirre us up to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, so we should enlarge, and plainly set out Gods justice and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, that fear thereof might keep us from sinne.</p>
                  <p>But it is Gods judgement oftentimes seen, that they which will not see Gods goodness by thankfulness, shall not see fearfull vengeance untill they seel it, because of the hardness of their hearts. <hi>Eve</hi> which before so enlarged Gods restraint, making a mountain of a

<hi>Eve</hi> taketh upon her to single them both at the last, because fear might not too much terrifie her; she qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth with <hi>forte q.d.</hi> peradventure if we sinne you shall die, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure no; so that the full perswasion of the truth and certainty of Gods word is decayed in her; and indeed this is the behaviours and natures of all wicked ones, by this
<hi>né forte,</hi> to incourage themselves to goe forward in sinne and transgression; for if they did perswade themselves and fully believe the certainty of Gods word, that God indeed would so severely punish sinne as his word doth shew, no doubt then they would never dare to break Gods Law, it would be as a bridle to pull them back from evill.</p>
                  <p>This her dealing then is an argument of the decay of her faith by wavering doubts, for as she hath let goe her hold and hand-fast of love and liking Gods word, and made the knot of faith very loose, so now there is nothing but fear of punishment which enforceth her yet to hold her to God, and to keep her back from open rebellion and<pb n="262" facs="tcp:62585:158"/>disobedience for if it were not for <hi>ne fortè</hi> which doth trouble her minde, if she were once sure of <hi>nequaquam moriemini</hi> instead thereof, why then the match were fully made, and she would without delay eat of it, as we shall see hereafter. Now we see unto what the Devill hath brought her, love is gone, faith is faint, and fear is feeble, hanging but by a small thread, for she is come to that pass as to make death a peradventure, a thing very doubtfull whether it will come or noe, saying <hi>fortè moriemini,</hi> whereas indeed she of all other things in the world might have been most fure of this, and said <hi>certè moriemini,</hi> for this is the Decree of God, that seeing we dallyed with his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threatned, and doubted of it as a thing of hap-hazard; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by his Decree hath made it a Statute of all other most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, never to be repealed or reversed to any; for it is made a Law and Statute, that all sinfull men shall once most certainly die, to teach us that this threatning was not in vain, and to make us not to dally with the fearfull judgements of allnighty God, not to doubt of them as our Grandmother
<hi>Eve</hi> did. Now let us work the means and degrees by which the Serpent led her from innoceny unto finne.</p>
                  <p>First her mislyking conceit, not content with Gods goodness but suspecting his hardness, corrupted her will, and decayed her love to God and delight in his word: Then these questions <hi>cur &amp; nè</hi> corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her faith, which shewed it self in her <hi>ne fortè;</hi> so that faith being qualified, instead thereof the Devill did plant doubt and unbeleefe; love being allayed, instead thereof he placeth discontentment and mislike: God gave her sure hold-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and bound her to him by a threefold Gable, which one would think should not be thus easie broken, namely by love, faith, and fear; but the Serpent having shorn asunder the cords of faith, and also filed the links of love, now all the hold she hath is only by fear, which when the Devill seeth to be somewhat loose, and that it stood upon <hi>fortè,</hi> we shall see how suddenly he will snatch that out of her heart, and so make her reach out her hand unto finne.</p>
                  <p>This then is <hi>fumus incendio praecedens,</hi> we shall see the firie flame insue this smoke, wherefore we must listen to the counsell of the Wiseman <hi>ergo nos quantum in nobis est è lubrico recedamus,</hi> for where the Serpent hath made the ground slipperie, there our nature can scarce stand upright; let us not therefore give any occasion to the Devill; open not any gappe to his temptations as she doth, <hi>but resist the Devill and he shall flye from thee without doing thee hurt.</hi> And thus much of the first part of their conference.</p>

                  <p>But it may seem that she giving such eare and credit to the spirit of lies, having the knowledge of Gods truth, that by Gods just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments she was blinded and could not see, as it oftentimes commeth to pass, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. 24. 26.</p>
                  <p>Now we are come to speak of the particulars of this reply, in which we see first his drift and intent is, to remove and take away that little fear of Gods judgements which was yet remaining in her, and kept her from eating the forbidden fruit; wherefore in this speech he seemeth friendly to reprove her, <hi>q.d.</hi> Alas! you are more timerous and fearfull a great deal than needs; you are all this while in an error if you perswade your self, that you shall die for eating this fruit, for I tell you and will prove to you, that without all peradventure you shall be so sarre from any danger of death hereby, that you shall not once taste of death at all.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see him with an impudent face and blasphemous mouth, to face her out with his bragging argument drawn from his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; for if we consider the matter of his speech, it is nothing at all but that which commeth out of his forge of lies, for <hi>he is a lier from the beginning, John</hi> 8. 44. Thus he opposeth his own word to the infallible word of Gods truth, and would have it taken and believed before that which God hath said,
<hi>q.d.</hi> You are too credulous to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve all that God saith to be true, for I tell you in this point it is not true, for you shall not die.</p>
                  <p>Now because there might be a question and doubt, whether all this that the Devill saith be gospell and true; therefore he craftily rendereth a reason for the proof and confirmation of his assertion.<pb n="264" facs="tcp:62585:159"/>His first reason to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> that he saith true, which ever since hath been the practise of the Devill in wicked men, to teach them by swearing to call God to witness against the truth, as if he were the maintainer of their falsehood and lies, which is not only the taking of Gods name <hi>in vanum</hi> but also <hi>in falsum,</hi> which is most divelish.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he will take in hand by a plain demonstration, that they should not die by eating of this fruit, after this sort; God doth envy your good estate, which by eating this fruit you may come unto; for God knowing that by eating it you should become equall to himself, doth therefore take this order and course to keep you from it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to tell you and make you beleeve, that if you once eat of it you are poysoned and undone, as if it were deadly, whereas indeed it is most sovereign and precious; In which you see how impiously and bla phemously he chargeth Almighty God of envy and of a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minde, and that of a Serpentine malice, such as is indeed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, namely, that he (under the colour and pretence of good will) doth cover and hide his hatefull and spitefull minde withall, which might have made her to say of the Devill, as <hi>Paul</hi> did of <hi>Elimas the Childe of the Devill, Acts</hi> 13. 10. <hi>O pater mendacii &amp; plenus omni dolo; O inimice veritatis &amp; justitiae:</hi> For as blasphemous <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> did <hi>Isaiah</hi> 36. 15. so doth the Devill here <hi>facet Deum falissimum &amp; fala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissimum,</hi> the rather to deceive simple men.</p>
                  <p>Now for the second part of his speech; it conteineth a promise to open their eyes, to deifie them and make them as God if they eat this,
<hi>q.d.</hi> Tush, what talk you of dying the death; God which maketh a shew of loving you as a friend, doth goe about to hide and keep from you the fruit which is most precious and more beneficiall to you than all the trees of the Garden besides; for it is not only good and wholesome for meat, but also of such rare and divine virtue, that it will make them that eat thereof as God knowing all, &amp;c. So that by advice, ye should rather forbear all the trees in the Garden than this one which is forbidden you. This may seem to be the effect of his speech; but now particularly he will goe forward to shew her what the speciall hidden virtues of this tree are: first saith he, it hath a power to open your eyes: In which speech he seemeth to perswade her, that as yet they were in the state of blinde men, as if the eyes of their mindes were hooded and blinde-folded, so long as they had not the knowledge of evill as well as of good: So the Devill misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth their estate because they knew not evill, but God would have had them so holy, harmeless and good, that they should not so much as once know what any evill should mean, much less to doe or seell evill; but the Devills intent and desire was to make them know evill, both by act and also by wofull experience to their utter overthrow. But suppose that it were a want and imperfection in them, we know that their duty had been to have sought to God for remedy, who in <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>willeth all such blinde ones to buy eye salve of him,</hi> but they<pb n="272" facs="tcp:62585:159"/>making the Devill their Physitian, became indeed starke blind, and had both eyes
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> clean out.</p>
                  <p>The second bait wherewith hee doth fish to take and entrap her is, <hi>sicut Dei,</hi> in which hee doth promise to deifie her, and canonize her as a God in heaven; he would perswade her that it were too base an estate for her still to remain as a Lord and Prince on earth, he would have them to aspire to all Honor, Power, Glory and Majesty, that they might once come to bee as God, without check or controll of any other superior power.</p>
                  <p>This apple of preferment renown and dignity, is the bait at which all ambitious and vain-glorious men doe greedily gape after and are taken by the Devill. By this then appeareth that the devill was the first which went about to make and have more gods than one, and his speech is to this effect
<hi>q.d.</hi> Your God is a jealous God, and by his good will would not admit any other to be as good or equall to him, he cannot abide a partner; but I will tell you how you shall attain to this honor whether he will or no, only eate of this and it shall bee so. Thus the Devill beginneth to set up another kingdom against the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of almighty God.</p>
                  <p>The third and last bait is of knowledge, which he addeth for the more assurance, lest the former two should not take; for it is
<hi>q.d.</hi> Although happily you can be content with this estate in Paradise as sufficient for you, yet if that move you not, then look to this excellent gift of knowledg unto which you shall attain hereby.</p>
                  <p>Now even upon all these principles and reasons, he inferreth his conclusion thus. Seeing you shall reape and receive all these benefits safely and without danger of death: Therefore why doubt you? why forbeare you any longer to eate of this fruit? Surely, if the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of lies had not blinded her eyes, the image of light and knowledg which was in her might have perswaded her this. That all these things which the Serpent had spoken could not possibly bee true: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it standeth with common sense and reason, That God which made all things, would never make such a Tree which should be so prejudiciall to his own glorie.</p>
                  <p>Therefore she might have well answered the Serpent to all this. That if it be a Tree of such force and virtue, he should first begin to her and eate of the fruite, that then she might see him to be as God knowing all things she might know that he said true, and then follow his counsell and doe the like; But this sheweth that the Spirit of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had blinded her eyes and bewitched her heart; for it is Gods just judgement that when men are thus farre overgrown in pride that they should be blinded, <hi>Psal.</hi>

The faculty Vegitative, whereby man liveth, is allured in that it is said to be <hi>good for meat:</hi> The facultie<pb n="273" facs="tcp:62585:163"/>Sensitive, of the sense, is tempted, for that by the second the eye, which is the very chief of all the senses, by the pleasure of the fruit, is allured. And for the third facultie, which is reasonable, he had this inticement, That the reason should be advanced, and should have greater knowledge. In 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 16. these are the three inticements of the world, The first is concupiscence of the flesh or carnall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: The second is lust of the eyes, which is the wantonnesse of the looks: The third is the pride of life, or ambition; and with these was <hi>Eve</hi> inticed, <hi>as eye service pleaseth men, Coloss.</hi> 3. 22. so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure delighteth the eye here, the lifting up the eye to be as Gods, and the curiositie of knowledge; the one is the pride of sense, the other is the pride of reason. She supposed that in the tree there was not only <hi>utile</hi> and <hi>delectabile,</hi> but even <hi>omne desiderabile,</hi> what ever good might be desired: She took this tree to be as the <hi>Pandora</hi> of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, wherein were all the gifts and graces to be desired, to be found: And by the eating of this tree, so adorned with all things, she accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be Mistrisse of all pleasure, of all knowledge.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Good for meat</note>First, <hi>It was good for meat.</hi> True it is, that man must have meat to preserve life, <hi>cibus enim habet umbr am naturae nostrae,</hi> meat hath the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of our nature; we are bound in a statute and strong band, by meat to save and preserve nature; this is the band of necessitie which he hath bestowed, not only to eate of one tree, but he had the varietie of all: And though God had allowed him many more trees than ever he could eate of; yet he will be looking upon the only tree God hath reserved to himself, yet must she needs desire to taste of <hi>fructus veti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> the forbidden fruit; She is so dainty mouthed that she must needs eat thereof, though even with a curse she were forbidden it; thinking because it was forbidden, it would be more pleasant; for, as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>stolne waters are sweet, and hid bread is pleasant, Proverbs</hi> 9.

                  <p>The chiefest of the three goods is, <hi>that it is atres to be desired to get knowledge,</hi> whereupon chiefly she relieth that she shall attain the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<pb n="274" facs="tcp:62585:164"/>of good and evill; every one desireth knowledge. <hi>Triplex est tentatio,</hi> this latter temptation is treble: <hi>Eve,</hi> seeing the tree, is tempted by necessitie, by vanitie of the eye, and curiositie of reason: she should have followed the advise of

                     <note place="margin">1.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. Securitie.</note>The second is a neglect of fear, which is a security: God he hath made me Monarch over all the Creatures; he hath given me all the trees, which are infinite, in
<hi>Paradise:</hi> what though I eat of an apple, surely I shall not dye? for so small a matter God will not punish me.</p>

                     <note place="margin">3.

These are the three causall sinnes, The neglect of love, the neglect of fear, the negligence of that is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and the curiositie of that is needlesse.</p>

                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. Tediousness.</note>The second primitive sinne is Discontent, a malecontented minde; which is the tediousnesse of this yoake, whereby this commandement and easie restraint is a burthen unto them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3. Self-love.</note>The third sinne of this kinde is of the lower part of the soul, which is self-love; Accounting her self as if she had made her self, not as if she were made by God: <hi>I see the tree is wholsome and to be desired,</hi> why should I then seeing this refrain from it?</p>

<note place="margin">1. Stupiditie.</note>First from Incredulitie in Gods word commeth a Child, which is the credulitie in the Serpent, which is called <hi>stupor,</hi> an astonishment at the Serpents speeches, which is a blockish patience in being content to hear the most abject Creature,

                     <note place="margin">Three Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall.</note>The last is the instrumentall sinne:

<hi>Esaus</hi> eating of his pottage for which he lost his birth-right.
<hi>Eves</hi> eye saw the fruit, her arme reached to take the same, her mouth did eat the same. The first is, a licentious beholding; the second is, a presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous taking; the last is, a greedie eating and devouring of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit.</p>

                  <p>At what time the Serpent beginneth his temptation, he beginneth with one, not with both; with the woman, not with the man; with the weaker, with her that was but a rib of mans strength, with one that is more credulous of his word than man, to whom the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is delivered; in a word he maketh her to fall, who is lesse able to stand: So that there were then but two sinners in the world, the Serpent and the Woman; <hi>Adam</hi> was still upright: But here when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> eateth of the forbidden fruit, he maketh up the third sinner.

<hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 16. The Serpent when he hath plaid his part and made her eat, he is gone: But as the Sepent was the Devils instrument to tempt the woman; so here the Devil, instead of the Serpent, will work the destruction of the Man by the Woman, causing her to give the forbidden fruit unto him. Sathan by the Serpent, <hi>which was the most craftie and the most sabtle,</hi> made his first assault: And here he made his second assault upon Man <hi>per charissimam,</hi> by her that was most dear unto him: for in that he saith of her in <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>she is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh, she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man;</hi> that she weth his affection of his earnest love to her: He useth
<hi>subtilissimum</hi> and <hi>charissimum,</hi> that which is most craftie, and that which is most deare, as his two instruments; He tempteth the weaker and simpler by subtiltie, the wiser by affection. As I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he assaulteth the weaker, Woman, that was but a ribbe, having the commandement but by tradition from her husband, who had it from God himself; and so here in his temptation of man, he assaulteth the affection, which is the weaker part of mans soul; For <hi>S.

Sathan he knew well, that such was the affection of Man to his wife, that he reposeth such trust in her, that he will not examine what she demandeth, nor refuse what she offereth;

<hi>Adam; Adam</hi> he would not have looked toward the Serpent, nor toward the tree, had it not been that he regarded the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>Eve.</hi> This is his means, by the perswasion of the Woman, to get his affection, and that so Sathan may seize upon it: But this is the counsell of <hi>Nahum, chap.</hi> 7.

The Devils resolution here is by the woman, whom Sathan had enforced to assault man:
<note place="margin">Perverting Gods Councel and purpose.</note>So he shall be sure first to pervert the councell of God; Secondly, the woman shall enter deeper into <pb n="283" facs="tcp:62585:168"/>sinne, by making man to sinne; Thirdly, that Sathan might be Master thereby of them both.

<note place="margin">2. The Devils gain, and <hi>Adams</hi> losse.</note>Lastly, is the Devils gain by the losse of <hi>Adams</hi> soul, which standeth upon two parts, the one is on <hi>Eves</hi> part, and the other on <hi>Adams</hi> part; <hi>Eve gave to her husband, and Adam did eat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the former, <hi>Eve, after she had eat of the fruit,</hi> she wiped her mouth, <hi>and gave of the fruit to Adam;</hi> like the adulterous woman in <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 20. <hi>that eateth and wipeth her mouth, and saith I have not committed iniquity;</hi> after she hath satisfied her own desire, she maketh as though she had not offended: <hi>When she had sucked the gall of Aspes, and when the Vipers tongue had slain her, Job</hi>
20. 16. she then wipes her mouth, as though there were nor death nor danger in the same; <hi>and having eaten her self, she giveth to her Husband to eat also:</hi> Evill did Sathan doe, and knew it to be so; <hi>Eve</hi> she had after the fall flattering inticements in her mouth, <hi>her words were as oyle, but the end of her spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches was bitter as wormwood; her feet goe down to death, and her steps goe down to Hell, Prov.</hi> 5. 4.5. But yet <hi>Eve</hi> here thought she had done well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sinnes brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth sin.</note>You shall see the nature of sinne, that sinne bringeth sinne, unlesse it be extinguished by repentance; for <hi>Austin</hi> saith well of sinne, <hi>Quod nisi deleatur duplicatur,</hi> which, unlesse it be extinguished, it is doubled. In
<hi>Esay</hi> 14. 29. the Prophet saith, <hi>That out of the Serpents root shall come a Cockatrice, and from the Cockatrice egge shall come a firie flying Serpent, and here from the Serpents malice came</hi> Eves <hi>sinne, and from</hi> Eves <hi>sinne came Mans fall, the Serpents temptation brought forth</hi> Eves <hi>disobedience, and that Cockatrice egge hatched</hi> Adams
<hi>downfall,</hi> and so they were both robbed of their righteousnesse: This is their discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho, Luke</hi> 10. 30.
<note place="margin">Rebellion with sinne.</note>Againe, after the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath eaten, this her giving of the fruit to her husband to eate, is a further circumstance in the nature of sinne, to add rebellion unto sinne; for the devill will not only seduce the woman, but (by her) will seduce man;
<hi>for he draweth also the mighty by his power, Job</hi> 24. 22. The Serpent will destroy both the weak and the strong, the foolish and the wise.
<note place="margin">The sociable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes.</note>Thirdly, Sinne will be associate; for the sinner will try the righteous if he will offend, that even here <hi>Adam</hi> may be as deep a sinner as her self; for indeed good fellowship is not so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently seen as among sinners, <hi>for they joyn hand in hand, manum in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, Prov.</hi> 16.

<note place="margin">Sinne infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note>Fourthly, it is hence observed that sinne is infectious. The Serpent he infected <hi>Eve</hi> with his breath of craft and maliciousnesse; made her beleeve him and eat of the fruit; and she being infected her self, infected him; This is called Pollution: He that toucheth pitch is defiled. She went not only out of the way her self, but she caused many to fall from the Law, <hi>Malach.</hi> 2. 9.
<hi>her word did fret as a canker,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh 2
<hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17. for sinne is contagious, it poysoned <hi>Eve</hi> and
<hi>Adam</hi> also. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Austin</hi> upon this saith well, That if God strook blind the soul of <hi>Eve,</hi> she could not see her own miserie from her originall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
<note place="margin">The Serpent gave, and <hi>Eve</hi> gave the fruit.</note>The Serpent gave to <hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> gave to
<hi>Adam</hi> the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial fruit, but not with like affection. She in giving to <hi>Adam</hi> of the fruit, thinks she doth him an especial favour, and that whereof he needs not fear; for though by the giving him the same, she take away from him original righteousnesse, the favour and fear of God; yet she accounteth that she makes him a great reward: But this her reward may well be compared to the present of <hi>Ehud, Judges,</hi> 3. 16. <hi>who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented Eglon the King of Moab with a curious made dagger,</hi> wherewith after he killed him: The Apple wherewith <hi>Eve</hi> presented <hi>Adam</hi> was his destruction; but yet (as I said) she did it not with the minde of the Serpent; for he caused her to eat of a malicious minde, knowing it would be her bane: Yet <hi>Eve</hi> she gave it to <hi>Adam</hi> of a good affection, not of any malicious intent.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2. Means that women seduce men.</note>Now the means wherewith she induceth man, to bring him to eate, are of two sorts, which are the two means that women use to seduce men withall; both are by the voice, as you may see in 17. verse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; <hi>Adam obeyed the voyce of his wife,</hi> so that it should seem that she used some oration to perswade him,
<hi>&amp; blanditiarum verba,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Flatterie.</note>and flatterring words, 1
<hi>King.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>The idolatrous wives of Salomon turned his heart to Idolatrie, blanditiis, by their flatterie:</hi> And here <hi>Eve</hi> saith to
<hi>Adam</hi> as it were thus, You may see that I have eaten and find the fruit to be pleasant; I have eaten, and yet I am living: and thus with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of love, she wisheth <hi>Adam</hi> that he would eate.
<hi>Adam,</hi> in the mean while, as a Father saith well, stood in doubt either to eat or not to eat, <hi>inter preces uxoris, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minationes Creatoris,</hi> between the prayer of his wife and the threats of his Creator; God had said, <hi>in the day they did eat thereof they should die,</hi> he saw she had eaten and yet was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: <hi>Salomons</hi> wives,

So that these are the two means wherewith woman overcommeth man namely <hi>blanditiis &amp; importunitatibus,</hi> by flatterie and importunitie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">And he did eat.</note>Now it followeth to speak of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, <hi>And he did eat.</hi> In the 17: verse of this chapter, God curseth man <hi>because he had obeyed the voice of his wife,</hi> and for that he had eaten of the tree, whereof God had commanded him
<hi>that he should not eat;</hi> whereby you see, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:62585:169"/>the giver of the forbidden fruit, but the taker thereof also; both the perswader and the consenter to sinne deserve death. The manner how he consented is in this (<hi>with her:</hi>) <hi>Adam</hi> he came to her, not she to him, say the Fathers: For although God had created Man in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse, though he were placed by God in Paradise, and though Gods love to man were shewed in making <hi>Eve to be his help,</hi> yet he gave no eare to the speeches of Gods love, nor to his threats, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hearkned unto
<hi>Eve</hi> and her allurements: The woman hereby is convicted of carelesnesse, and the man of negligence, in that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth her to wander from him where she pleaseth: but the woman must not depart, no not a little, lest she fall. A third thing is <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adams</hi> curiositie of this tree; they would eat it to try what virtue was in it; they would try a conclusion, if they should eat thereof whether <hi>they should dye,</hi> as God had said, or <hi>be as Gods, knowing good or evill. Moses</hi> commanded
<hi>That there should be no manna reserved till the morning;</hi> yet
<hi>Exodus</hi> 16. 20. some there were that would try conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that obeyed not <hi>Moses,</hi> but reserved it till the morning, and it was full of worms, and it stank. Again, as it appeareth in that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to try conclusions some there were, contrarie to <hi>Moses</hi> words, that <hi>upon the Sabbath day went forth to gather Manna. Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. saith, <hi>I fear lest as the Serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your mindes should be corrupt from the simplicitie that is in Christ.</hi> In
<hi>Adam</hi> his body from his soul, his sense from his reason should not have swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>Eve</hi> beleeved not God, but the Serpent; <hi>Adam</hi> beleeved not God but <hi>Eve. Paul, Coloss.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>would have us rooted and builded in Christ, and stablished in the faith:</hi> But the root of all bitternesse is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; for <hi>Adam</hi> seeing <hi>Eves</hi> case, that though she had eaten of that pleasant and forbidden tree, yet she was living, and that there was as yet no apparent signe of any ill, thought the rather surely God spake not this in earnest, neither for the eating of a small apple shall man dye. But should have accounted Gods word to be infallible, and that
<hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem moriêris</hi> was a sentence of condemnation: Faith should be rooted in Gods word; but from incredulitie, which is the root of bitternesse, it commeth that he beleeveth <hi>Eve,</hi> by an inordinate love, not of lust, but of necessitie to his wife; which we call a bashfulnesse; and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers call it <hi>noxia verecundia.</hi> In 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 4. <hi>So long as Davids sonnes shall walk in the way of truth with all their hearts and all their souls, their posteritie shall inherit the Kingdome. Adam,</hi> by eating this fruit shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a desire in him to grant her request; he loved her entirely, for that she was taken out of him, and given unto him by God, and then there were no more women in the world: <hi>He did eat</hi> that he might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>indulgens maritus,</hi> a most loving husband: that as
<hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>In unitate peccati etiam socius sit,</hi> that even in the unitie of iniquitie he might be her companion. The Heathen call

                  <p>Now by the 22. verse you may see the ambitious desire of
<hi>Adam,</hi> to become as God himself <hi>to know good and evill:</hi> therefore it is by the Fathers presumed, That by <hi>Eves</hi> information he presumed to be so: He was now wearie of <hi>credere</hi> and <hi>obedire,</hi> to beleeve and obey God and his word: He desired now to command and controll; to be <hi>non sub Deo, sed sicut Deus,</hi> to be no longer under God, but as God: his faith and obedience became a burthen; he was not content with his knowledge of good alone, but he would needs by eating at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>the knowledge both of good and evill;</hi> he began <hi>frige fieri in affectu,</hi> to waxe cold in his affection toward God: And lastly, he made full account that he should be preferred; he should not be punished; none should be so excellent; he should be equall with God. But if that God were angrie with him, yet
<hi>Adam</hi> had his excuse, that he for the love and entire affection to her which was taken out of himself, for a good minde which he had to her, gave her his consent to eat of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit; which they gather out of the twelfth verse of this chapter, where <hi>Adam</hi> saith, <hi>The woman which thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat:</hi> He did behold what <hi>Eve</hi> did see and thought that thereby he should attain knowledge. But here the Holy Ghost, to avoid rediousnesse, briefly without any farther repetition, saith, <hi>And he did eat. Adams</hi> understanding it was corrupted, his will it was infected, he was perswaded <hi>that he should be as a God,</hi> and that there was great virtue in the tree, whereupon he transgressed, that is, he went beyond the Commandement; God said <hi>he should not eat,</hi> but <hi>he did eat.</hi> Whereas <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and was in the transgression.</hi> The Serpent deceived <hi>Eve</hi> and
<hi>Eve</hi> was Sathans instrument to deceive <hi>Adam.</hi> Upon which place the Fathers doe make inquirie of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, saying, That
<hi>Adam</hi> yeilded to <hi>Eve,</hi> though he were not properly deceived by her; this his sinne, say they, is the sinne of necessity, not of his will.
<hi>Salomon,</hi> for the love he did bear to his wives, was tempted to Idolatry; <hi>Ahab,</hi> for fear, committed murther: It was neither love nor fear of God could keep man in Gods commandement, and yet they impute malice to God, <hi>and they are even set on mischief, Exod</hi> 32. 22. <hi>Adams</hi> sinne came out of himself, out of <hi>Eve</hi> which was his rib. Wickedness first came from the Devill himself, and his Cockatrioe egge that hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth iniquitie is malice; <hi>he that imagineth to doe evill, men call the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of wickednesse, Prov.</hi> 24 8. According to the old and ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb in 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 14. <hi>wickednesse proceedeth from the wicked.</hi> Sathans wickednesse is of malice, <hi>Eves</hi> wickednesse is of error, <hi>Adams</hi> is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie; then cometh <hi>noxia verecundia,</hi> a guilty shame fac'dness. <hi>Adam</hi> he fell of infirmitie, in that he loved his wife more than he loved God.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Divines, considering <hi>Adams</hi> sin, doe consider the same by the circumstances, which are seven.
<note place="margin">1. The person.</note>The first circumstance is of the person. <hi>Adam</hi> he was Gods vassal, from whom he received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite benefits, whom he made governour of <hi>Paradise,</hi> as if a Countie Palatine, to whom he gave a short Law, and an easinesse not to sinne; to whom he gave strength to withstand all violence; to whom he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:62585:170"/>all the trees in the Garden, reserving but one to himself; for whom also, being alone, he made woman to be to him a meet help: The bond of love unto God was before ever there was any <hi>Eve:</hi> It was love that linked <hi>Adam</hi> unto <hi>Eve,</hi> it was fear &amp; love that linked <hi>Adam</hi> unto God; he therfore should have regarded more the word of God, than of woman.
<note place="margin">2. The Object</note>The second Circumstance is in respect of the object, against whom he offended; he sinned against God that created him, that gave unto him the government of Paradise, as a Father saith well, <hi>Quem nunc despicitis
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit,</hi> he whom now you despise is your maker: Besides it was he that made her to be an help, but now she setteth her self against God: He gave to <hi>Adam</hi> a commandement,
<hi>brevissimum &amp; levissimum,</hi> that was most short to be remembred, and most easie to be observed seeing that he will offend him that is so gracious, seeing he will break that Law which so easily may be kept, this circumstance maketh the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> to be the greater.
<note place="margin">3 The motive and retentive to and from sinne.</note>Thirdly, They doe consider the motive to sin, and the retentive from sin: What was it that moved <hi>Adam</hi> to sinne, and to lose Gods favour? It was but an Apple, a small fruit that seemed pleasant to the eyes, wherein there was but a short and transitorie pleasure, while the fruit was a eating and in the mouth. But the retentive was in the highest degree,
<hi>mortem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> greater than the pleasure.
<hi>Paul, Philip.</hi> 2. 8. faith of Christ, <hi>That he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himself, and became obedient unto the death, even the death of the crosse.</hi> But here on the contrarie part, <hi>Adam</hi> exalted himself, he became even disobedient unto the death, the everlasting death of body and soul could not withhold him. The motive to sinne was small and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive was great and terrible.
<note place="margin">4 The manner.</note>The fourth circumstance is the manner of sinne, It was <hi>citò factum,</hi> soon committed.
<hi>Peters</hi> denyall was <hi>ad vocem ancillulae,</hi> at the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of a sillie made.
<hi>Adams</hi> transgression was without delay at the voice of his wife.
<note place="margin">5. The Place.</note>The fifth circumstance is of the place, It was in Paradise that he was polluted: But though
<hi>Lucifer</hi> were the most glorious in the Heavens, yet for his pride God sent him headlong from the Heavens. Man was Monarch of the earth, all in
<hi>Paradise</hi> were at his command, yet for his disobedience God sent him out of Paradise.
<note place="margin">6. The Time.</note>The sixt circumstance is of the time, He was servent in obedience in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but he continued not therein many dayes; time as a file filed away his righteousnesse; he sell in the beginning.
<note place="margin">7. The Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</note>The seventh circumstance is of some notable hurt, <hi>aliquod damnum,</hi> that should come to man by his disobedience, whereby both God and man are damnified: It before, while he was righteous, he were in the image of God, for in the likenesse of God was <hi>Adam</hi> made, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 1: then surely, by mans disobedience, Gods Image in man was defaced: <hi>Adam,</hi> who was now unrighteous, was no more like God, who was only righteous and

<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> speaks <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 22. <hi>was foolish and ignorant, he was even as a beast before God:</hi> and his sinne was not only his own confusion, but the ruine of us all, of all mankinde: It is Christ Jesus that will make <hi>our sinnes and iniquities to be no more remembred, Heb.</hi> 10. 17. It was the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Adam</hi> that brought

                        </gap>,</hi> a grievous burthen to all the world: from this sinne came all sinnes; hence came the heap of all evill. The Fathers say that <hi>Omnia

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:62585:171"/>this is the greatest sinne, it deserveth the greatest punishment.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Divines consider a difference in <hi>Eves</hi> sinne and in <hi>Adams</hi> sinne. <hi>Eve</hi> she sinned in three respects; First, In hearing Gods name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully blasphemed: Secondly, In that she heard this blasphemie, not from the mouth of an Angell of light, but from a paultry and abject Worm: And lastly, In that she became <hi>scandalum,</hi> a means to slander God and seduce Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adams</hi> sinne is seen in three other respects; First, The man was stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and yet he was seduced by the weaker: Secondly, Man was made as the womans head; and therefore when he heard her say she had eaten, when he did see her offer him of the forbidden fruit, it was his part to have reproved her: Thirdly, the root of nature was in him, not in her; yet the corruption of all came by <hi>Eve</hi> unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and from both to us all; which hearing the words of the Serpent and the Woman, which seeing the pleasant fruit, which eating of the forbidden tree, did bring the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and death of body and soul to all men living.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Remedy.</note>But the remedy for this so vile and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For it is not in Gods Court, as it is in the Courts of men, where the way to confess the fault and fact, is the way to be condemned; but with God the only way to be absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and acquitted from sin is truly and unfainedly to confess our sins unto him; &amp; this is the end, why God in mercy doth send to them the opening of their eyes, that they might see their sin, &amp; it began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail that we may see the effect it had of them; for though as yet the nobleness of their nature was such, that they feared nor (for there was yet no fear to them) yet we see they were ashamed, &amp; by it were driven to seek a covering to hide that shame with all; but that effect of their seeing and shame was not good; for whereas it should have made them return penitently to God from sin, which was so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they instead of turning to their own hearts, and to God, doe run to the figge tree leaves to make them coverings withall; and so this Counsell of God in sending their signe was disanulled and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from turning to God to stepping to the figge tree. And so whereas God appointed and sent the opening of their eyes for their good and conversion, the Devill doth cause it by this means to turn to their greater destruction.</p>
                  <p>By which we see how the Devill and sin doth infatuate men, and make them foolish and ignorant how to doe that which should be for their good and salvation; but as the Prophet saith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 22. The Devill and sin whetteth their wits making them very sharpe &amp; <hi>wise to doe evill,</hi> to hinder their salvation, and to make them coverings and excuses to conceale, cloak, and colour their sin withall: at this we are very good, and have a present invention to coynelyes and excuses, but we are dull and blockish to prevent the danger which sin doth bring.

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the next place their ingenious art and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, in that on such a suddain without study they are able to sowe and peice them together; so that they did serve insteed of bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to hide that nakednesse withall, this we are able to doe of our own natural inclination, <hi>sine Magistro:</hi> which disposition of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature we see by experience in all men even untill this day; for doe we not see wicked men given over to all evill, which in any good matters are very dull &amp; blockish, and in Religion very senselesse and rude, yet in this to be very ingenious and witty, to invent divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses to hide and colour their sinnes withall; herein their wit and art never faileth them, but ever serveth them well, wherefore of us may the Prophet also say <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 22.
<hi>they are wise to doe evill, but to doe well they have no understanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second default that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> made in this was, that the devill taketh up the whole roome of their hearts, with the care and consideration of their bodily defects, not regarding the spiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness and shame of their faults.</p>
                  <p>The third is, in that they seeing their nakedness, doe not seeke to take away the cause of the shame, of their sinne, but the effect, which is their nakednesse and shame; which is as if a man, seeing and knowing himselfe to be sick, should not seeke to remove the cause of his disease, but the <hi>Symptomata</hi> and outward accidents thereof; as if a man should only be carefull to take away the pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his face, which are but outward accidents of his disease, and never regard to remove the heat of the Liver, which is the inward cause thereof, and this is the third offence <hi>quia dolebat, &amp; cur abat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decus peccati, non peccatum,</hi> his care was only to be rid and acquitted of the shame of sinne, and not of sinne it self.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if this nakednesse which they see be so evill and so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, then this also is another fault of theirs, <hi>quia nolunt tollere sed tegunt eam,</hi> for indeed their desire should not be so much to cover as to care it; but their care, <hi>è contra</hi> is, <hi>non curare, sed velare,</hi> and this is the nature of men now a daies in their distresses to seeke <hi>invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucra, non remedia,</hi> that is, maskes to cover and hide, not meanes to care and remedy their soul offences.</p>
                  <p>The last and sift, is that vanity of this covering of the fig tree leaf; for as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, Wilt thou needes have a covering of thine owne seeking and making to hide thy sinfull nakednesse, then thou art foolish and mad to goe to the fig-tree for leaves, thou shouldest rather have gone to the Rocks and Mountains, and cryed to them <hi>Cover us, Ose</hi> 10. 8. for they are thicker and more able to cover, or if thou wilt needes have it of leaves, why wentst thou not to the Tree of Life, whose leaves are said <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 2. to serve<pb n="291" facs="tcp:62585:172"/>for medicine to cure and heale withall;
<note place="margin">☜</note>This then was another fault, in that they rather went not to the Tree of mercy <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> but to their own Tree of hypocrisie; or why went they not to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live Tree, because that seemeth to be a tree of mercy? <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 11. for the Dove bringing a branch of that, shewed that Gods anger was appeased, and was a signe of mercy; or else why did they not make a covering of that of which the mercy fear was made? One of the Fathers saith, I have heard indeede, <hi>Esay</hi> 38. 21. that a cluster of figges had a virtue to cover &amp; heale, but as for the leaves of that tree, they quickly fade and fall away to nothing, <hi>Esay</hi>
34. 4. or though the substance of the leaf could endure, yet the thread where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are sewed together would not hold, but be broken when God doth teare them off, the 13. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the 20. and the 21. and then where will be their covering which they have made. But of all the rest, the greatest fault of all was, in that they rested quietly and securely in this vain covering which they had made, saying <hi>pax, pax,</hi> tush, all is well enough, we are safe and neede not feare, and in this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure carelesnesse they continued untill the evening: This made <hi>St. Augustine</hi> say, I suspect this garment and covering, for it seemeth to be a fit reward for their eating the forbidden fruit, that after they had eaten that fruit, they should have for their labor a handfull of fig-leaves, <hi>What fruit had you of your sin, whereof you are now ashamed? Rom.</hi> 6. for God giveth shame and confusion, and the devill sendeth only a handfull of vanity for all that

8, 9. God sendeth <hi>spiritum compunctionis,</hi> and the Devill sendeth a snare and stumbling block for the recompence of their sin.</p>

                     <hi>Learne a Parable of the fig-tree,</hi> saith our Saviour Christ, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 32. which Parable, as the best and ancient writers think, is taken from this here; for by way of Parable they say, that this fig-Tree which the devill planteth fast by the Tree forbidden, hath two mighty great and mayne armes which grow out of it, each whereof hath divers branches and maine leaves growing thereon. The one is the arme of excuses, whose leaves are to hide sinne and shame by excusing it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 141. 4. The other hath growing on it divers pretences to defend their sinne, by making policies to cover it withall.</p>
                  <p>The first, chiefe, and principall is, when men will set a good face and justifie their ill-doing as <hi>Jonas</hi> did, <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 9.
<hi>Doest thou well to be angry?</hi> Yea (saith he) <hi>I doe well to be angry at the heart,</hi> this is a fig lease of justifying and defending his fault.</p>
                  <p>The second is <hi>tergiversatio, Mark</hi> 14. 68. when one is challenged and accused of a fault, to seeme ignorant and simple, and therefore innocent of any such matter; I know not what you meane! I heare you not!</p>
                  <p>The third is <hi>Recriminatio,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 3. 16. that is, To lay the fault on another, as the Harlot being accused to smother another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans childe, she thinketh to shift it off this way, <hi>Shee hath smothered my childe.</hi>

                  <p>A Second consideration of this is, that as shame is the outward Sergeant which seizeth on the body and flesh appearing in the face, so fear is the Seargeant of the heart, seizing on the Soul within, and as shame for his object is seized with ignominie and infamie; so fear hath for his contrarie object danger and doubts of evill, either present or imminent, and shame belongeth and is seen in them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or especially, which have some grace and ingenuity, and humane disposition or reasonableness: for beasts are not said to blush or be ashamed, for it pertaineth not to unreasonable Creatures.

                     </note>thus we see the different nature of feare and shame, the one moveth those which are ingenious and have grace and wit in them, but the other is sent to move those which are bruitish and blockish and of a servile nature.</p>
                  <p>Now we will come to the words of this use, in which we are to consider two points, the one is in <hi>Adams</hi> part, the other in Gods behalf; that which concerneth God is set down in four speciall points.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walking,</hi> that was the manner of his comming. First, that <hi>God came:</hi> Secondly, that <hi>he came walking:</hi> Thirdly, that
<hi>he came with a voice,</hi> and was sensibly heard: And lastly, for the time of his comming, that was <hi>in the cool of the day,</hi> which is the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, of which four points: First for the first we must know, That when God is said to come, to walk or to speak, that Gods spirit, in the Scripture, useth those poor phrases and manners of delivery for our weakness and infirmitie, because we cannot otherwise well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive these things in God, for to speak properly to come to a place which indeed in his own nature is every where, and filleth all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with his presence, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 24. The Prophet
<hi>Isaiah</hi> 66. 1. saith <hi>the earth is but his foot-stool,</hi> and we know that one cannot walk on his stool, he properly can but stand on it; therefore some think to satisfie this place, that God is said to have appeared here, and was heard walking and speaking, not in his own personall presence, but <hi>per dispensationem,</hi> sending an Angell, as it were, in his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>: But there are some which doe think that it is not necessary, and that we need not grant here any such extraordinary and visible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition and presence of God, in any shape or resemblance; and that<pb n="294" facs="tcp:62585:174"/>that which <hi>Moses</hi> saith
<hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 15. of Gods appearing in <hi>Horeb,</hi> may truly be affirmed and avouched of this place, namely, that they only heard a voice, but saw no shape or visible likeness, or represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which appeared to their eyes, and therefore that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and knew Gods presence comming to them, not by the eye seeing any thing, but by the care only hearing a sound or voyce; for so we read that he came and appeared <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Elias,</hi> in such a strange manner of voice and sound, that they might by it know that no creature but only God the Creator, which could come in such a majesticall, and glorious sound and in this sense, we may take these words, because it is said, <hi>they heard Gods voice wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi> and not that God came visibly walking; he was heard spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, not seen walking.</p>
                  <p>The second point on Gods part is, <hi>quod venit Deus ambulando,</hi> by which walking is commonly meant, such conveying as Judges use when they come to judgment, and to try matters to be judged, <hi>Prov.</hi>
8. 20, 2. It is said of <hi>Samuell</hi> which judged <hi>Israel, that every yeer he walked and ment about all places in Israel,</hi> as Judges doe goe their circuits and perambulations, <hi>to Judge the people,</hi> 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 16. So that this in effect and substance is that which is said before, and signified by his comming, namely his purpose to give sentence and to execute just judgment against their sinne.</p>
                  <p>The third point concerning God, is, that his walking was not
<hi>in silentio,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> saith, but with an audible voyce,
<hi>Job</hi> 4. 16. and that such a voice as <hi>Ely</hi> heard, 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>which should make their eares tingle and glow,</hi> that it was a terrible and fearfull voice terry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them for sinne.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and last thing is the time, that is, <hi>in sero,</hi> in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>And therefore doth God wait untill the evening, Esay</hi> 30. 18, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would willingly have mercy on them, which rather by right and reason should wait for him;</hi> But when we regard not Gods sending, God doth oftentimes wait and tarry so long before he commeth to Judgment, that his delaying, late tarrying and waiting, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times becommeth offensive to the godly, and scandalous to the wicked, for so the godly cry,
<hi>Lo how long wilt thou tarry to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of the blood of thy Saints, and the enemies of God doe slander the foot steps of his annointed, Psal.</hi> 89.

                  <p>That course which <hi>Abigail</hi> took, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.
36. is the course<pb n="295" facs="tcp:62585:174"/>which God useth, that is, in the spirit of discretion, to deal with men when the fit or rage of sinne is past, and when their blood is cooled, for it is no medling with a man in his drunken fit or in his fury of heat and rage, because their advisement and senses are then taken away, the Prophet <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 24. would have us to see the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and discretion of men of experience in this case, <hi>who will not seek to take the wilde Asse when she is lusty and light, for then at that time she will snuffe up the aire proudly and scornfully, and none can turn or tame her,</hi> therefore saith he, <hi>take her in her moneth,</hi> when she is great with young, and then she may easily be caught and tamed, this must be our wisdome and discretion, when we see them rapt and bereft of their senses, to bear and suffer them untill the tempest be overblown, and the heat of their sinne cooled and somewhat allayed.</p>
                  <p>Now to the second severall point, which is <hi>Adams</hi> part, which sheweth the effect which this voice of God wrought in them, and how they demeaned and behaved themselves, when Gods voice came to them, which is set down in two things: First, <hi>They heard it:</hi> Secondly, <hi>They hid themselves from God,</hi> which is amplified after two sorts: First, <hi>That they hid and shrouded themselves in the shrubs and thickest of the trees:</hi> Secondly, <hi>That they hid themselves from the presence of God,</hi> and this is the effect, which his comming and voice wrought and heard in them, for which (because, between hearing and hiding, there must goe something) the writers doe finde out these severall things.</p>
                  <p>First, for the hearing we say and may see, that it is a mercy and favor of God, in that he did not only open their eyes being blinde making them see their foul sinne; but also open their eares, being deaf, that they might hear of the danger of their sinne, but this is a new counsell, a stratagem of the Devill, the evill counsellor, to make them flye away at that voice, which should have been the means to have brought them to God again,
<hi>Peccatum est fuga,</hi> as divines doe say, therefore the Devill will have them <hi>bis fugitivi:</hi> having fled from God by sinne, now to flye again further from him by despair and there to hide themselves, as who should say, without doubt your God commeth in just and angry mood, to make an end of you for sinne, therefore by mine advise haste and flye away from him; this is the Devils custome and comfort, when he hath brought men into sinne, as plainly he sheweth himself, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 16. When he had brought <hi>Saul</hi> into sinne, he saith, why comest thou to me, seeing God hath forsaken thee? God will surely punish thee as he said, &amp;c. Where he sheweth himself in his right kinde: This is all the comfort we shall finde at his hands, when we have committed sinne; for when we have followed his ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, he will say thus to us, you hear how angry God is, how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and fearfull his voice, his steps towards you and presence is, wherefore fly, for how will ye be able to abide his hand and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which are thus afraid at the sound of his steps and voice?<pb n="296" facs="tcp:62585:175"/>But if <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> doe and needs will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> from their life, health, liberty, and hope of all the good they have, that so the Devill might be sure that they should perish in their sin.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, we see into what miserie man is fallen for a little vain pleasure of sinne, which lasted but the space while the apple was chewed in their mouthes, but that vain short delight being vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and gone, now remain their extreme miseries for ever, except the mercy of God provide a remedy; For first we see it brought on them nakedness and shame: Secondly, blindness and senselesness, that they could not see their shame and sin: Thirdly, the worme of conscience when they saw it for as a garment breedeth a moth which will destroy it, so doth sinne breed his gnawing worm, which will torment and destroy sinners: Fourthly, when it was seen, it brought on them confusion of face without: Fiftly, a horrible feare and trembling of the heart within: Sixtly, to avoid and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, it taught them the folly and fondness of vain hypocrisie, with figge leaves to cover it: Seventhly and lastly, it brake out into a desparate madness and frenzie, in that sinne and Sathan per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded them, that they must flie from God, and hide themselves from him, as without hope of his mercy. And therefore we see now that they had lodged themselves in the brakes and thickets of the shrubs and bushes, but all in vain, as we shall see hereafter, for that which they had made their Castle and Covert to lodge, hide, and keep themselves safe, God maketh to be as it were their Goal and Prison, out of which he will bring them to judgement, and to the Barre to be araigned, as we shall see in the next verse.</p>

All this verse, as the ancient Writers term it, is as the voice of an Archangell crying before the first Judgment;
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 16.</note>for as at the last day of generall judgment, shall first an Archangell be sent out with a voice of a Trumpet to scite and summon all flesh, to arise out of their graves, in which sinne hath hid and lodged them till then: So we see at the first Judgment of man before God beginneth, he first sendeth out a voice calling and crying to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to arise out of their
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:62585:175"/>prison, and to appear before God to receive according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts and works, for God did usually use the voice and ministerie of Angels, by whom he did commonly speak unto men, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. 8. God spake unto <hi>Agar</hi> by the voice of an Angel, and that voice by which God spake, was the voice of an Angell, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 22. 26. and that also,
<hi>John</hi> 12. 28. 29. And the reason why God speaketh to men by the ministerie of Angels is, because his voice is not propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to our hearing and weak eares; it is farre above our reach, and therefore he speaketh by Angels, framing their voice more fit and agreeable to our nature, and thus generally of the words of this verse.</p>
                  <p>More particularly we are to observe two parts; first, that God did call to <hi>Adam:</hi> Secondly, the effect or contents of his calling. The first is a proclamation, the other the tenor and substance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: The matter and contents of his calling is judiciall, but as Gods song over is as well of mercy as of judgment, <hi>Psal</hi> 101. 1. and his works of bountifulness, as of severity and justice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 22. so will we proceed in the handling and declaring of this his speech, first shewing his mercie therein, and then speaking of them as they declare and set out his severity and justice.</p>
                  <p>Touching his mercy which he remembreth in judgement, the matter thereof here contained is two sold: First, as Gods mercy hath been seen in these four points, In sparing them; In making them see their sinne; In sending his Messengers to them; And in comming himself to them.
<note place="margin">First point.</note>So this is the first point, and a degree of mercie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and beyond all, in that as he came, so he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> to speak and talk with him, which I doubt not to make the fist degree and step of further mercy.</p>
                  <p>These things considered, that every use and action of God doth set out a new mercy unto man, is a verifying of the gracious saying of our Saviour Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 37. <hi>quoties te congregare volui, ut gallina pullos suos sed noluisti?</hi> And this is a fault in <hi>Adam,</hi> that he did not first goe to seek the Lord and crie to him, <hi>ubi estu domine?</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than God should come to him and say, <hi>ubi es Adam?</hi> or when he had perceived that God was walking towards him first. This is his second fault, that he did not prepare himself with fear and humility, to meet the Lord, and fall down low before his foot-stool; for <hi>Shemey</hi> in policie saw it best when he had offended <hi>David,</hi> and heard that he was comming into his Country again, first to make haste to runne and meet him with submission and humility, that so he might procure grace and pardon, as indeed he did 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 19. 20. but <hi>Adam,</hi> insteed of crying to God as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>de profundis,</hi> doth betake himself to flying, and therefore God as a friend pittying his estate, doth pursue and follow him in his flight, and speaketh to him in his silence, and so preventeth him every way, that he may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And all this is done to him, to set down to us, that men might be moved hereby to say as <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>I will sing of the loving kindness and mercy of the Lord; my tongue shall ever be talking of his</hi>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:62585:176"/>
                     <hi>praise, Psal.</hi> 149. 1. and that we might consess with thankfulness, <hi>that his mercie is above all his works, Psal.</hi> 59. 16.</p>
                  <p>The second generall point, is the tenor and contents of the voice and proclamation; where we must note, that this question <hi>ubi es?</hi> is not <hi>vox ignorantis, sed increpantis &amp; tamen clementis Dei;</hi> For the tenor of the words doth savor much of mercy, for when God had found
<hi>Adam</hi> all hid, he breaketh not out into the cruell and bitter invective as <hi>Shemei</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>Come forth, come forth, thou murtherer and wicked one,</hi> &amp;c. Which severe voice man deserved and God in mercy might have justly used, but God according to his goodnesse and nature doth mildly begin to deal with him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>ubi es?</hi> And thus writers gather, because the Hebrews have in their tongue a double <hi>ubi,</hi> the one is a reproachfull and sharpe <hi>ubi,</hi> but this here is that which
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> in his <hi>Lamentations</hi> doth often use, and therefore is a sorrowfull <hi>ubi,</hi> as who should pitty them which are not where they should be? wherefore this voice and question is without any exprobrations or bitter taunting words, lest he should be overcome with despaire and grief, but hereby God doth as it were give him a safe conduct, as it were, giving him free leave to answer for himself the best he could, as it is said fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorably to
<hi>Paul Act.</hi> 24. 10. You are permitted to speak for your self, you shall be favorably heard, which is a speciall grace and mercy of God, because whereas he might have cut him short off, and stricken him dumb, yea and dead too, without any more a doe.</p>
                  <p>Now to the tenor and matter of this verse, as it sheweth and letteth out the Justice of God, for as God is mercifull and loving, so Justice must come forth to judgment against sinne, <hi>Psalm</hi> 94. 15. For this is a matter of consequence, that albeit God is for a long time patient and mercifull, yet at length he will shew himself to be righteous and just by comming to judgment: but indeed even Gods very judgment is a mercy shewed to men, as I have shewed; for so is this judiciall proceeding in judgment set down, as a favor and mercy <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 15. shewed to servants and subjects; for <hi>vers.</hi> 27. it is said to be the state of an enemy to be slain without judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for of such God saith, <hi>bring him forth, slay him before my face presently:</hi> Again, <hi>carry these away, binde them and cast them into utter darknesse.</hi> They therefore which will not hear God <hi>ut consulentem patrem,</hi> shall hear against their wills, <hi>ut condemnantem judicem:</hi> And he which will not obey the Judg willingly, shall obey the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whether he will or no.</p>
                  <p>This course of Gods judgment holden, being the first, is a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and plat-form of the whole proceeding of judgment, in all Courts and places of Justice, that shall be in the end of the world; for here in this place we may gather the whole right proceeding of Justice in a place of Judgment; for in the 7. vers. God sendeth out first a processe to arrest and cite them; which they refusing, in the 8. <hi>vers.</hi> God sendeth an attachment, which is a more peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory kind of vocation more effectually, by feare, to constrain them<pb n="299" facs="tcp:62585:176"/>and bring them to their answer; which, when they had shifted off also, he came himself; and in the 11.
<hi>vers.</hi> brought them to their triall and purgation; then in the 12.
<hi>ver.</hi> there followeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his guilty conscience; and then followeth the just sentence in the 14. <hi>vers.</hi> and in the 22.
<hi>vers.</hi> beginneth the execution thereof; and so an end.</p>
                  <p>Gods course therefore is first to call forth <hi>Adam</hi> to his answere; but this may seem at the first sight, to be a defective course, because here is none but the Judg, and the party arraigned, to accuse, and to be a witnesse against him; upon which the Judg might proceed; for, no other person being there, it must needs be, that either God must proceed in this Judgment <hi>ex officio,</hi> or else make <hi>Adam</hi> accuse himself:
<hi>Foelix, Act.</hi> 25. <hi>vers.</hi> 16. saith that <hi>it was not the manner of the Romans to arraigne any, before there was brought in evidence against him by accusers and witnesses;</hi> but to answer this, we say, that as it were erroneous to hold that there was no third person to accuse him, for here is the Devill which is <hi>the accuser of all men,</hi> therefore there wanted not an accusation; and besides him which accused by suggestion, no doubt
<hi>Adams</hi> own conscience within, and evident a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction without, did accuse and witnesse against him; for <hi>Adams</hi> flight and hiding himself, accused him of feare and shame; and fear and shame argued him to have a guilty conscience; and his guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science accused and testified against him that he had done some hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence against God; and so the evidence of his crime being manifestly layd open before them all, God might, and must orderly proceed in Judgement against him.
<note place="margin">Error.</note>Therefore it is also an error in those which hold that there may not be any just, lawfull, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary proceeding judicially against any unlesse there be brought
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> face to face to accuse them; for it is plain and evident, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon such strong presumptions, one may be called before the Judge, and the Judge may judicially proceed against him thereupon; as we see in the case of murther how God proceeded against <hi>Cain, Gen. chap.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12. and how God proceeded against
<hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Gen,</hi> 18. 20, 21. and how they proceeded in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary course against <hi>Jeremie, Jer.</hi> 29. 26. when the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the trouble and confusion of a Country or Commonwealth; for if it was permitted to a private man by the Law of Jealousie, to make his wife purge herself, and to bring her to triall upon surmise and suspicion,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 14, 15. &amp;c. then much more may (men in authoritie, who must be jealous over the Commonwealth and State of a Kingdome, when they see it in danger by troubles and tumults that arise) use such an extraordinarie manner and course of judgment in bringing men to their trialls, of whom they have a strong suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and surmise to be the causers thereof: for so did
<hi>Joseph</hi> to avoid danger to the State, upon surmise and suspicion, call his bretheren before him, accusing them for spies.</p>

Now this following of the Devills counsell and advise in this place, is so much the worse in <hi>Adam,</hi> and so much the more to be condemned, because twice before he had followed it with ill success, and saw he was deceived, which might have been a double caveat and fair warning to him now to beware; but as he had followed the Devils counsell twice before in practise and deed, so we shall see him to follow it twice hereafter in word: For first of all touching his word and speech, the Devill teacheth him a peece of his Sophistry, teaching him that he must needs answer, to put <hi>non causam pro causa:</hi> And secondly, in the other place he teacheth him a peece also of the Devils Rhetorick, which is called <hi>translatio crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> a laying the fault upon another, and so shifting it from himself, outward covering, and inward dissembling hath a very good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence, and therefore hypocrisie is compared to a Cloak or masking Hood. <hi>Job</hi> saith 31. 33. <hi>If I hide my sinne as Adam did, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing my sinne in my bosom,</hi> will not God finde it out and punish it?</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Adam</hi> being bewitched and infatuated by the Devill, that spirit of error, had learned to make choice rather to strive with Gods justice, than to appeal to his mercy for favour and grace, whereas by confessing he might have had pardon, he by defending it, brought himself the more deeply into judgment, and his sin the more into question and triall.</p>
                  <p>By confessing his sinne, Christ would have been his advocate to plead for his pardon, but by defending and justifying it, he made
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:62585:177"/>him to be a Proctor to plead against him, and Judge to give sentence against him; whereas by confessing his disease, God would have been his Physitian, to heal him; he <hi>è contra</hi> by taking on himself to heal his own sickness, made himself and his disease more grievous and more desparare.</p>
                  <p>But let us come to see how he seeketh a <hi>quia</hi> and an
<hi>ergo,</hi> that is a good reason and argument to defend and justific his deed: Let us I say come to the particulars of his answer, and see the strength and validitie of his reasons, for if it be good and justifiable, it will hold the proof, and the examination will doe it no hurt: Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which; first we know it in corrupt policy, that it is good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to begin a lye with a truth, or at least with great likelyhood of verity, that so the lye may after run more currant and goe more roundly away; therefore at the first, in the forefront of his answer, he places indeed a manifest and known truth, that he heard Gods voice: and the second also is truly said, that nothing might be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, namely, that he was afraid. In which two truths confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the Fathers doe say, are contained the first and second degrees, which by Gods Decree should have been the two chief induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to move men to repentance; and therefore in that he was not moved to submission and confession of his fault, thereby they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that this part of his confession also is against himself; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these two evasions are nothing but to make against his cause.</p>

Thus we see that this <hi>quia</hi> and
<hi>ergo</hi> will not stand; it is not Gods art or workmanship nor his voice that made him feare, flie, or hide, but somewhat else which he had done and committed, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be, which God will bring to light and make apparent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>Now let us come to the consequence here set down, <hi>ergo abdidi;</hi> for which we shall perceive that this is no good or right reason or consequence, which he should have inferred uppon the premisses; for thus he should have concluded: I was afraid and naked and fled for conscience of my sinne; therefore I confess humbly my sinnes before thee, and doe crave pardon for them. Thou diddest open mine eyes that I saw my sinne, and thou openedst mine eares by feare, that I knew thy judgment; <hi>ergo</hi> now also open my mouth, that I may confess humbly, and open my heart, that I may repent truly for it; thus he should have made his consequence: I heard thy presence with majesty comming, <hi>ergo</hi> I prepared my self to meet my Lord right humbly, confessing my finnes, that I might have found pardon: this was <hi>Jacobs</hi> resolution and conclusion in policie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 7. when he heard that
<hi>Esau</hi> came against him, he feared and was troubled, and therefore used all means preparing himselfe to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his wrath, and prevent the danger by praying to God, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring presents to him; but of all his follies which are yet seen herein, it most appeareth in that which <hi>Adam</hi> here useth for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, maketh most against him, in that this which he useth and challengeth for his defence and appoligie, is indeed the very occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his condemnation, as we shall see in the next verse; in which God maketh this his confusion of his nakedness, wherewith he chargeth God to be the very ground of his occasion and interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, which he cannot avoid, nor finde any colour nor evasion for, but to confess himself guilty.</p>

                     <note place="margin">February 5. 1591.</note>NOW we are come to proceed in the judiciall part of Gods cause and manner of judgment, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which we have seen before, this order to have been observed.</p>
                  <p>First God sent a Sergeant to arrest him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scite him to make his appearance to answer for that which should be laid and objected against him, in the seventh verse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he sent out an attachment more forcibly to lay hold on him, and to apprehend him, which he fled from, in the eighth verse.</p>
                  <p>Then God came himself, making search for him being hid, and brought the Malefactor out to his arraignment, and to answer to <hi>ubi es,</hi> in the ninth verse, which is his inditement and accusation.</p>
                  <p>Then God will have him make his plea to his inditement, which he doth in the tenth verse, pleading not guilty; for though he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the fact laid against him, that he is out of his <hi>ubi,</hi> and is fled and hid, yet we see that he so confesseth it, that he traverseth the right and lawfulness of that deed done by him, which is <hi>quia</hi> and <hi>ergo,</hi> saying God was the cause of it: he could not doe otherwise, for God spake so fearefully to him, that he could not but flie, and God made him naked, and therefore he hid himself: In saying which he seemeth so to maintain and uphold his doings, as if he had said, I have therefore done well in thus saying and hiding; yea, I should not have done well if I had done otherwise; and so his plea is, that he is not to be charged of any ill or offence in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
                  <p>Now to this answer God maketh a rejoynder and answereth that plea of his, by a double interrogation: In which God first of all joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth issue with him in that one point, which is plain and evident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them both by his own confession, namely, that he was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and then bringeth in such an
<hi>ergo</hi> against him, that <hi>Adam</hi> could not choose but confess his offence, and could not conceal or shift it off any longer.</p>
                  <p>For God proveth to him that it could not be, that he should come ever to the knowledge of his evill and shamefull nakedness, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the act of eating the forbidden tree, so that he taketh out of his own mouth and words confested, that whereby he will make matter enough to judge and condemn him, namly, that he knew that he was naked and ashamed to shew his face; for upon this point, he joyneth issue with him, and upon the strongest part of his <hi>quia</hi> and reason, as who should say, be it true which you have<pb n="304" facs="tcp:62585:179"/>said, stand to the words confessed already, let us both grant and agree in this point and issue, that you know that you were naked and ashamed. I demand of you but this one thing, answer me if you can: How came you to know that you were naked? thus he beginneth to debate the matter to the proofe: let us therefore now see, how he traverseth this point with him; his reason must be framed after this form.</p>
                  <p>That which was evill <hi>Adam</hi> might not doe, this is a morall ground; but it was evill that <hi>Adam</hi> being naked, should know it to be a shamefull thing, and to hide; therefore <hi>Adam</hi> in knowing this his nakedness, hath done some ill. Thus standeth the reason.</p>
                  <p>Now God would know of <hi>Adam,</hi> how he knew nakedness to be evill, and the reason of the doubt and question is, because it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that <hi>Adam</hi> presented himself naked (before he sinned) without any shame or hiding, therefore here groweth the question, how he knew it to be so now?
<hi>Adam</hi> knew his nakedness was evill: God asketh how he came to the knowledge of any evill, <hi>q.d.</hi> who brought thee acquainted with this knowledge of evill? there is no man in the world to teach it thee, and there is no other means in the world by which thou maist attain to it, but only by eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden tree, which of this effect hath his name, to be <hi>the tree of knowledge of good and evill. Ex arbore didicisti, ergo de arbore comedisti,</hi> for there was no ordinary way or means to come to this knowledge by the decree and counsell of God, either to the knowledge of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill by privation of God, or else to the science of evill by wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and sense of evill, but only this way, by eating of this tree forbidden.</p>
                  <p>This then is that point in which God joyneth issue with him, to make and enforce him to confess the truth; by which two points; the one of joyning issue in one instance, and so closing with <hi>Adam</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>The other concluding by an invincible proof, the breach and transgression of that negative Law of God, <hi>non comedes</hi> &amp;c. We ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessarily thereout, that this is the right and orderly course of proceeding in upright judgment, and determining of causes here taught and allowed by of God, to be imitated and put in practise, namely, that after the indictment and accusation laid against any man for transgressing a Law, either for doing evill forbidden, or not doing a necessary God commanded, that then the party so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, must be brought to his answer personally, and permitted quietly and freely to put in his answer thereunto, for the acquitting himself if he can.</p>
                  <p>For these are two other parts of Justice and right Judgment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods Law, and this is a good and a lawfull proceeding, as we may see by the example and practise of the Church of God; and this is called a course of Judgment, according to law and equity, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> 10. 3. and as <hi>St. Paul</hi> saith,
<hi>Judge aright according to Law, Acts</hi> 23. 3. of which every good &amp; just Judge must have a speciall care.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:62585:179"/>Another point of this proceeding further is, that after the party accused and arraigned hath put in his answer and pleaded not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that then the Accusant doe goe forward and see the issue joyned with the Defendant, and a plaine evidence and proofe of his act done to convince him and prove him guilty, by his own words or deeds, if he can.</p>
                  <p>For so doth God deale with <hi>Adam</hi> here, saying thus; It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by your own confession that you knew your selfe to be naked, and you cannot deny but that you informed your selfe with that knowledge of evill, and it is plaine that there is none in all the world which hath taught or told you so; therefore I conclude against you that there was no way for you to know this, but only by eating of the forbidden Tree of knowledge, whereof I therefore challenge and charge you. These then are the two points of proceeding.</p>
                  <p>That there be a state of the question in controversy made, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to an issue, and then that there be proofes and arguments brought to convince the falshood and to shew the truth, that so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies may be justly determined; as wee may see in this Case which is brought in tryall here,
<hi>Adam</hi> saiththat hee did flie and hide himself indeed, but the motives and causes which induced him to doe it, and the reasons why he did it were, because Gods voice was so fearfull, and because God had made him naked.</p>
                  <p>Now God joyneth with him in the point, and will prove that it was not Gods workmanship, nor his voyce, but <hi>Adams</hi> own sinne, which was the true cause of his flight and hiding; So in <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 14. S.
<hi>Paul</hi> being arraigned and indicted before <hi>Foelix,</hi> hee doth not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely deny the matter which they layed against him, but confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth how farre hee is guilty, and in what respect he is not, saying; <hi>I confesse that I worship God after that manner which they lay against me and call Heresie,</hi> but it is not Heresie; let them prove that, and I will yeeld, for it is according to the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Thus he shewed how far he did that they accuse him of, and how far he will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and shew good reason that he did not so as they charged him falsly; that so the matter in Controversie before the Judge might grow to an issue and point agreed upon between them, and that the state of the question might bee known truly unto all.</p>
                  <p>There be two things therefore to be performed on both parties in strife, which the Judge must take order for, that the matter may be decided.</p>
                  <p>The one is called <hi>Citatio realis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other is <hi>probatio realis,</hi> and both of them are most necessarily required <hi>adcognitionem rei;</hi> for they must not only be caused to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the Judge, but also when they have made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, they must not stand dumb and speechlesse before the Judge, but both speak and declare for themselves; And we may see it warrantable by Gods word and the practise of the Church, that not only a party may be caused to witness a truth before the Judge,<pb n="306" facs="tcp:62585:180"/>for or against his neighbour in a matter doubtfull, and that upon his oath, as we may see
<hi>Leviticus</hi> the fifth chapter and the fourth verse, and the first of
<hi>Kings</hi> the eighteenth chapter and the tenth verse, but also in the clearing of himself being suspected, as we see, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the thirty sixt chapter and the seventeenth verse, <hi>Acts</hi> the twenty third chapter and the twentieth verse; yet there are exceptions to be taken in this matter, as we see <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the thirty eighth chapter and the fourteenth verse; when the King would bring <hi>Jeremie</hi> to examination in a matter that concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Jeremie</hi> made his exception; If I confess and tell all, wilt thou not kill me? for if the matter be capitall and concern mans life, he will not, to indanger his own life, answer no to the King: and the reason why a man, in that case, should not be bound to be a witness against himself is, because the Devill saith, <hi>Job</hi> the second chapter and the fourth verse, <hi>A skin for a skin, a man will doe or say any thing to save his life,</hi> and therefore no reason to urge a man so hardly in so high and capitall a point: But in other cases which only concern the loss of goods, or a matter of some punishment and mulct, a man must not refuse to answer, and that upon his oath, and this we see also warranted even by this judgment of God; And so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all these actions in our course of judgment, being laid to this rule of Gods first judgment, and the proceeding of justice being weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this balance, in the twenty eighth chapter of <hi>Isaiah</hi> and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth verse, that is, all things being done uprightly, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this pattern of Gods proceeding, we may be sure that it is good, lawfull, and just.</p>

                  <p>For Pride, as we said, hath two twins; the first is before the act of sinne before the fall, namely, to desire to be better than they are, and to be in higher estate than God hath placed them.

                     </note>The first is Arrogancy; This is Hypocrisie, both the whelps of pride, and vain glory, which at last turneth to shame: But the last is so much worse than pride, because it is <hi>tumor in timore;</hi> it is as much as to be proud when one is at the lowest; and so to life up himself, which is most unseemly: That reall Hypocrisie in action, of which we have spoken before, consisted in two points; <hi>In volucro, &amp; in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibulo.</hi> So here now we may see a double verball, hypocrisie in tongue and speech: That is, if there be any good thing praise worthy, that we must have ascribed wholly to us; but if any evill thing be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that must be put as farre from us as may be, Before his drift was by defence to put clean away all the fault from himself; but now he laboureth by excuse to be seen to have as little part in the fault as may be; and to have the shew and appearance of that evill to be put away from him, that he be not brought within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the offence.</p>
                  <p>His first defence, in effect is <hi>non feci:</hi> But now this excuse is <hi>feci, sed benè feci:</hi> When that would not serve his turn, his third excuse is <hi>feci malè, sed non multùm. q.d.</hi> though inceed I cannot deny, but I am in the compasse of the offence, yet I am not in the fault; I did not much of the evill that was done: And this is our nature when we cannot defend our selves <hi>à toto,</hi> then we excuse us <hi>à tanto,</hi> as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> doth, which saith you must not lay all the fault on me; for God and the woman have parts and shares therein, the woman for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the apple to me, and God for giving the woman to me.</p>
                  <p>This excuse then hath two parts, the woman and God, both which we will examine to see where the fault is indeed.</p>
                  <p>As it is a foul fault in a man to seek to excuse himself by accusing another; so it is another fault worse than that, that a man should make a silly woman the matter of his excuse; for we say it is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in men to pitty and spare especially that sex, as the weaker; &amp; a foul shame to seek to intangle and draw woman into danger or hurt, but rather to support and defend them as much as with modesty and honesty we could, <hi>Adam</hi> might have considered, that she heing the weaker, the first of <hi>Peter</hi> the third chapter and the seventh verse, that it had been his part to have made a buckler for her shelter and<pb n="308" facs="tcp:62585:181"/>defence, for men willingly should, and naturally are taught to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, and not to wreck their malice and anger upon woman-kinde. But the fault in him which passeth all is this, that this woman is his wife which he accuseth as the cause of his evill, and bringeth in as the principall in this fact; for by this there is
<hi>perfidia</hi> on his part, a breach of Faith and wedlock-love; for it is most unseemly and unnaturall for a man to accuse his own wife: If we consider that he which before in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 24. confessed <hi>that he should forsake Father and Mother for her sake;</hi> yea, which before (by sinne) was content to forsake God and all for her love; if he did love her so well, why doth he not shew it now? for he should have stood out betweene Gods wrath, and her, for her defence, which no doubt would have beene more acceptable to God, for it is a thing commended in <hi>Moses Psal.</hi> 106. 23. and in
<hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17. that they offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be punished to acquit and save others there from; for they were content to beare Gods displeasure themselves that others might bee set free, but here
<hi>è contra Adam</hi> was willing to bee in the society of the fact and fault, but now hee will pull his neck our of the Coller, and will not have any society or part with her in the punishment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Adam</hi> blameth God.</note>Now I come to the other part of his excuse, in which he layeth part of the blame on God, as bringing him also within the compass of this evill committed, <hi>vtinam hoc tantum dixerat Comedi,</hi> saith one, for to challenge God for giving this woman to him, and to come to upbraid God to the face with this, <hi>The woman which thou gavest mee</hi> made me to sinne, is another offence most intollerable. He will not be content with one excuse, but will have two strings to his bowe for fayling, that if the woman will not serve to bee his excuse, then this may.</p>
                  <p>To bring God into the fault, and to say directly that he is in the society, and had a part therein, is intollerable blasphemy. The womans excuse, which shee alledgeth in the next verse, is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; in accusing the devill: But to say <hi>Data a te dedit mihi;</hi> sinne was her gift, and she was the gift, thou gavest me the woman, and the woman gave me the apple of offence; wherefore if thou hadst not given her to me, the apple had not been given, and so I should never have sinned against thee, <hi>q.d.</hi> I did not pluck it, I was not the author nor cause of it; If I have sinned I may thank you for it; you were the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of all which gave her to me; you would needes give me a wife; if you had meant me that good which you pretended, you should not have given me such a one as would give me this forbidden fruit; or at least, if you must needs make and give her, you should not have joyned, nor put her together with me in the place and garden where I am, but put her in a garden by her self, apart, and separated from me; for I knew not else what she should mean by staying with me.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see that his excuse and allegation for himselfe; is partly<pb n="309" facs="tcp:62585:181"/>an expostulation with God, and partly an accusation against him; In both which he seemeth to say this in favor of his fault; it did not become me to suspect her of any evill whom thou gavest to bee a meet help and good for me; I thought that whatsoever she did, or should perswade me to, would have become good and helpfull to me; <hi>ergo</hi> I yeelded to it.</p>
                  <p>This we see is a foul fault to quarrell with Gods goodnesse, and to charge God with sin; whereas all iniquitie and sin God doth utterly abhorre: There is no affinitie between God and evill, for no evill commeth neer his dwelling, <hi>est ne iniquit as apud deum?</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the second to the <hi>Corrinthians</hi> the sixth chapter and the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse, to such which thus impudently reason against God: <hi>What agreement hath righteousness with unrighteousness;</hi> why then O man dost thou charge God with sinne? so that he fetcheth the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree of his sinne which he committed, and derived it thus even from God himself. The sinne which is, came by eating of the apple, which was the gift of <hi>Eve,</hi> which was the gift of God. Thus to make his sin inmeasurable sinfull, he deriveth his sinne from the holiest of all, and wrappeth not only the woman his wife in the transgression, but also fetcheth God in for company, as partner with them in this their evill.</p>

In Logick we are taught to bring and reduce every thing that is said or reasoned upon, unto the principall action or rule by which it is scanned. In Divinitie, it is a point especially materiall, as our Saviour Christ saith, to goe to the beginning and first institution of things; to see how it was then, And this is Gods course in judgment, to find out the principall and chiefe cause of evill things which are committed.</p>
                  <p>The way and manner of finding this out, is by inquirie, and by way of interrogations, ministring interrogations unto him for all crimes and sinnes being works of darkness; and therefore as much as may be hid and concealed from apearing in the light and sight of men, therefore the praise and labor of a Judge is to finde and search it out; that being brought to light, ill works may be reproved, the third of <hi>John</hi> and the twenty first verse: For this cause this duty is enjoyned by God to all Judges after two waies, the thirteenth of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> and the fourteenth verse, <hi>ut perscrutarentur &amp; interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garent, that by search and diligent inquirie, the truth might be boulted out:</hi> It is the course to be taken in the case of murder, the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty first of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> and the fourth verse: In the case of adultry, the fisth of <hi>Numbers</hi> and the fourteenth verse: In the matter of theft, the twenty second chapter of <hi>Exodus</hi> and the eighth verse:
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8. 31.</note>And it is the course which may be holden in any Crime or Cause whatsoever, that upon good and sufficient presumptions and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, they may proceed to inquire diligently, and the party called in question is bound to make answer, to purge and cleanse himself, which is suspected or accused; for this is the ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which God frameth his action against <hi>Eve. Adam</hi> saith that thou (his wife) diddest intice &amp; perswade him to eate thereof: The question therefore which I demande of thee is, why hast thou done this: And this is that, to which she is bound to answer.</p>
                  <p>Now if we looke to her answer, which she maketh unto the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatorie propounded to her, we shall see it very frivolous; for God asketh <hi>quare,</hi> and she answereth to <hi>quis;</hi> Some think that it was for fear, or shame; or else, as others say, for the defect of a right and a true cause: For well may one alledge the tempter and occasion which moved or sollicited us to sin; but otherwise no right or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cause of sin can be assigned. But howsoever it is, we must take her answer as it is: First, we see that she is not mute or silent, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to shape an ill answer, and to make an excuse as well as her husband: God saith, in the fiftieth
<hi>Psalme</hi> and the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth verse, because I held my tongue, and envyed no more against mens sin; therefore the Devill hare <hi>Eve</hi> in hand that <hi>Adams</hi> excuse went for good payment, and put God to silence, as if it had been so full an answer to God, as that he could say no more against him;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:62585:182"/>and therefore seeing that held so well; he perswadeth the woman to take the same course; for we shall perceive that both her and her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer are so like, as if they had been framed in one forge; for the like pride we see in both, which will not seem so ill as they are, but doe lay the fault upon another to excuse themselves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the method and form of answering is alike, and even the same in both their answers, but the substance and matter of the excuse is not one and the same, for <hi>Adams</hi> excuse was his wife <hi>Eve,</hi> but her excuse is the Serpent; so that if we compare <hi>Adams</hi> answer and
<hi>Eves</hi> together, we shall see in what they agree, and wherein they differ; both of their confessions are extort and indirect, both are maimed and unperfect, and neither of them can plainly say <hi>peccavi,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Therefore the Devill careth not what excuse we alledge, though they lay the blame of their sinne upon him, he is content to beare it, rather than they should confesse their sin plainly, and make Christ their Advocate.</p>
                  <p>To cover and conceale sinne is a double sinne; and not to confesse it plainly is partly pride, and presumption, or else servile fear and dispaire, fearing lest they should confesse all to God; as though he had not goodnesse or mercy enough to forgive them: or else they conceale it of pride, presuming that God cannot see and finde out that which they dissemble and hide from the eyes of men.</p>
                  <p>So we see that it is a compound sinne; though the woman be
<hi>in impari sexu,</hi> yet she is <hi>pari superbiâ,</hi> as proud as he; and as farre dead in hiding and dissembling sinne as he, and as well able to say for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as he;
<note place="margin">A difference of Confessing finnes.</note>thus pride maketh men ashamed to confesse, or else so to confesse, that one may see a plain difference between the confession of a proud, and a poor humble sinner; between the confession of the good and faithfull, and the evill Infidells: Between <hi>Sauls</hi> confession and

                  <p>But <hi>Davids</hi> confession is

<hi>Sauls</hi> spirit of hypocrisie will not confesse his fault, unlesse he may keepe his credit, and avoid the shame and discredit of evill in this world.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see that as the same humor and Teacher was to them both: So <hi>Eve</hi> shapeth her excusive answer by <hi>Adams</hi> patterne, which went before: For as <hi>Eve</hi> taught <hi>Adam</hi> to sin after the patern and example of her deed; so, to quit it now, we see here, that

<hi>Adam,</hi> the first man; and it may well be divided into two parts, First, his falling into sinne; Secondly, his falling into misery, the fruit of sinne. In the former are two things to be considered, first his temptation to sinne, from the first verse to the fifth: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his committing of the act and sinne it self, verse 6. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these two stand and depend his falling into sinne. The other part which is his falling into miserie, beginneth at the seventh verse and continueth to the end of the Chapter, and is divided into his Judgement, and the execution of the Judgement. The Judgement of our first Parents beginneth at the 7. verse, and continueth to the 22. the execution of it from the 22. verse to the end of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In the Judgement are two parts, the Tryall and Sentence, the Tryall went before, from the seventh verse to the thirteenth; the Sentence beginneth at this verse read unto you, and continueth to the 22. following.</p>
                  <p>The sentence is exceeding worthy the meditation of all men in respect of the contents of it; for that as it setteth down the mother or original curse, from whence all other curses proceed, as those <hi>Levit.</hi>
26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. which are nothing else but a laying out in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and particular of that which is here, So likewise, as the Lord is said <hi>in wrath to remember mercy, Hab.</hi> 3. 2. it contains also the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, yea that great blessing, in respect whereof all other blessings in the Scriptures are but glasses to behold this blessing; for you have in the sentence of this Curse, as the bitternesse of Gods wrath, so the consideration of the goodnesse of Gods promise, which the Apostle calls <hi>the most great and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

1. 4. <hi>whereby</hi>

                     <hi>we are made partakers of the divine nature:</hi> The sentence is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, as the persons arraigned are three, that is, against the Serpent, the Woman, and against <hi>Adam;</hi> wherein generally we are first to note the exact course and order of Justice that is kept in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Tryall. The order is this, First against the Serpent, as the principall Author, in the 14. and 15. verse following. Secondly, Against the Woman by good and due order, because as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle puts us in minde, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>the Woman was first in the transgression,</hi> and it hath a double respect; for whereas <hi>Adam</hi> sinned only in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it of her, but she both sinned and caused him to sinne; therefore the second sentence is against <hi>Eve</hi> in the 16. verse, the third a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Adam</hi> in the 17, 18, 19. verses following.</p>
                  <p>The second thing generally is this, that albeit there are three Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences against three parties, yet not all alike, or of one scantling, but there is a great and main difference between them: For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rule of Justice that the punishment be proportioned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the offence, as
<hi>Deut.</hi> 25. <hi>ut pro mensura peccati sit poenarum modus,</hi> And that
<hi>there be a difference put in having compassion,</hi> as <hi>Jude</hi> speaks in his Epistle verse 22. Therefore their offences standing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diverse degrees; one, that is the Serpent, being <hi>fraudis inventor,</hi> the other giving their assent; the one being the deceiver, the other deceived and seduced: there is great difference to be made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man fall by himself or by another; for to cause others to sinne, is a farre greater sinne than for a man to sinne himself alone. The first punishment and Sentence sets down the difference of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which God useth here: There is the punishment consignato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, called <hi>Virga,</hi> that is <hi>Moses</hi> rod; and another punishment when the rod becomes a Serpent; for the Serpent, that is not to chastise, but to denounce a punishment of cutting off. In such a case the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement of the partie is not sought, because there is no hope of amendment, but a correction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of others; and therefore the Sentence of punishment is greater against the Serpent, the Author of this mischief, than against the other.</p>
                  <p>A third thing general is, As an order and difference is kept, so an Analogie and proportion is well kept in setting down of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; for in as much as we finde it was the sinne of the Serpent in himself, his pride in lifting up himself into Gods seat; as the rule of Justice is that contraries be punished with contraries, so nothing was more analogicall than for his pride to be thrown down with extreme abjection and humiliation; therefore his punishment is <hi>to goe upon his bellie, and eat the dust;</hi> And as in the second person, because it was pleasure that caused the Woman to sinne, <hi>for seeing the Apple was fair to the eye, and good for meat, she was lead to eat of it;</hi> and therefore this pleasure of her is punished with pain: And in the third, For as much as <hi>Adams</hi> crime is set down two wayes, first, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his own ease too much, and not able to resist the temptation of the Woman alluring him, his punishment, saith <hi>Augustine</hi> for his too much safe, in not taking pains to withstand her, is labour and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:62585:184"/>travail, wherein is observed a very just analogie between the sinne and the punishment.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the particular sentence against the Serpent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in before we can intreat of it, there are two questions to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, First, when he speaks of a Serpent, we ask, What Serpent? because there is a visible Creature called a Serpent, but so also there <hi>an old Serpent, which is the Devill or Satan, Apoc.</hi> 12. that is a spirituall and mysticall Serpent, as well as a naturall and bodily Serpent, and the Sentence is against both; and as it is certain, according to the letter, all cannot be meant of the one, so neither can it be meant of the other: therefore, as the ancient Fathers teach, it is mystically and not literally meant of both; for as it is said that
<hi>the Devill eats no dust,</hi> so for the other Serpent, we say not that
<hi>the seed of the Woman shall bruise his head;</hi> therefore is it to be referred to both, the naturall Serpent as well as the other; as our Saviour Christ, <hi>John</hi> 3. 14. by <hi>the elevating of the Serpent in the wildernesse,</hi> shews there is another Serpent to be lift up, that is <hi>the Sonne of Man.</hi> By our Saviours war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that this stretcheth, as to the spirituall Serpent called <hi>Satanas,</hi> so to the naturall Serpent also.</p>
                  <p>In the second place we inquire, Whether it were in Justice that that Serpent should be punished, in so much as being a bruitish Creature without understanding, he could not understand that which he was set about by the Devill? The answer is, That it was great Justice, as to punish sinne it self, so the instrument all cause of it; For the Creatures being created for the benefit and service of Man, when it became a cause adjuvant in the destruction and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Man, so as he loseth the blessings and becomes subject to the curse; in this case it was but Justice to punish that Creature: It will better appear of like importance, the righteousnesse of which dealing is in the Law; for <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 28. God saith, <hi>If an Oxe gore a Man that he dye, the Oxe shall dye:</hi> And the reason of man doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to it, and <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 15. <hi>If a man lye with a beast, the beast shall be slain.</hi> But that which the ancient Fathers stand most upon is this, That the body of Man, the arms and other parts and joynts of the body are nothing but the instruments of sinne, as the Apostle speaks <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 13.
<hi>The members of the body are but weapons of unrighteousnesse,</hi> We make no question but the body may be whipt or burned, the eares and hands may be cut off, howbeit the sinne is in the soul, and the body, the soul being gone out of it, can doe no such act; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sentence against the Instrument is according to Gods Law; therefore God himself gave order that <hi>the golden Calf should be burnt to ashes, Deut.</hi> 9. 21. there was a Sentence executed against a thing not only void of reason, but without sense. But more fully to our purpose is the judgement executed by <hi>Ezechia</hi> upon the brasen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 18. 4. If that sentence might be pronounced upon that Serpent that healed those that looked upon it, then without questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this sentence may be executed upon the naturall Serpent that was the Devills instrument to work mans destruction, the rather if<pb n="308" facs="tcp:62585:185"/>we add hereto, that God had an intent, not only to punish the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but to make him an exemplary and visible chastisement, that he remaining so, the horror of him might strike into mans minde how he is punished, and that thereby they might be put in minde to take heed that they be not the instruments and occasioners of sinne; for here we see that they that are occasioners and helpers in any sinne, are subject to the sentence of Justice. And that may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice concerning the outward Serpent; for so the other which the Prophet calls <hi>the crooked Serpent, Isay</hi> 27. and <hi>St. John</hi> calls,
<hi>the old Serpent, Apoc.</hi> 12. there can no question be, but that the sentence may justly and must reach to him, that it is agreeable to equity and great reason, in as much as it was he that spake in the Serpent, that <hi>Qui in Serpente loquitur, cum Serpente maledicatur,</hi> saith <hi>Augustine,</hi> and he doth receive it in that order, because in the habit of a Serpent he presumed this, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. where the spirit that appeared in the likenesse of <hi>Samuell</hi> was called by the name of <hi>Samuell;</hi> after the same manner the Devill making his apparition in the likenesse of a Serpent, carries that name still.</p>
                  <p>In the Sentence it self we have to consider two things, that is, the Reason and the Punishment; the reason comprehended in these words
<hi>(because thou hast done this)</hi> therefore the punishment or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence followeth <hi>(thou art cursed)</hi> wherein there is yet another thing to be noted before the particular handling of it, because in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this verse with the verses following, we shall see a diverse course holden; for there to the Woman and Man God saith <hi>Quare fecisti hoc,</hi> alowing them their tryall and examination for the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of themselves, before he proceeded to give sentence: But no manner of tryall is allowed to the Serpent, but saith he, <hi>Quia fecisti hoc, thou art cursed;</hi> he is not permitted to come to his answer, the reason is plain; for if we take it spoken to the natural Serpent, he being void both of reason and speech, could render no reason, he comes only under the cause instrumentall; and for the other there was no reason of a reason either to be rendred by him or to be demanded of him, for he was before condemned, as the Fathers have noted, <hi>Isay</hi> 14. 14. and out of the sixth verse of <hi>Judes</hi> Epistle, And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, being in the state of a Rebell, was condemned already, and so was not to have the benefit of the Law, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>They that sinne without the Law, shall perish without the Law,</hi> as on the other side it is just, <hi>ut qui sub lege peccat sub lege pereat;</hi> but there is no reason that the benefit of Justice should extend to Rebels that are lawlesse; and therefore in Militarie affairs, we see that Military Law executeth such without sentence. Again, God knew that that which was committed by man and Woman, came not by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves but by the malice of the Devil; and therefore he ordeined that they should have more favour, and have their tryall, that they to whom the malice of the Devil had been prejudicial, to them the goodnesse and mercy of God should be beneficiall, that they might be saved by the goodnesse of God, that had been cast away by the<pb n="309" facs="tcp:62585:185"/>envie of the Devill; and therefore, saith <hi>Augustine,</hi> he seeks them out when they fled from him, and not only so, but he gives them a time to repent, and a time of answer, because there was in them hope of recoverie and amendment: But for him that was so indurate in malice, that to his power exalting himself to be like God, added this malicious and envious seeking of the fall of others, there was no hope either of pardon from God; or of amendment in him; for when Christ came into the world, he said to Christ <hi>Quid nobis &amp; tibi,</hi> there was no hope of him, being in the state of a Rebell, and so the seeking of the examination and tryall of him, as of the other, would not avail.</p>
                  <p>Now to the first part, that is, the Reason; In which we are to consider this, Why God begins not absolutely, <hi>Maledictus es,</hi> but
<hi>Maledictus quia,</hi> and so renders a reason why he is accursed, so exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the sentence, though not judicially according to course of Law, yet justly, that the mouth of all the world might be stopped, and that the infernall spirits themselves might be enforced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <hi>that the Lord is righteous and his judgements just, Psal.</hi> 119. 137. That the judgement is just, though the tryall hold not, the reason is <hi>quia fecisti hoc,</hi> he was the doer of that, and was the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the platform of that act; and therefore God begins with him, wherein, as the ancient Fathers note, God would have us to observe two senses, first the sense of the emphasis; and the second of difference.</p>
                  <p>For the emphasis, Gods meaning is, because thou hast done this, <hi>quia fecisti hoc,</hi> that is, that thou hast overthrown Man, for whom all things were created, and consequently so much as in thee lay, hast sought to overthrow my determinate Councell, and to bring to naught all that I have made, therefore thou art cursed for doing this. Then for as much as we see this emphasis of Heaven and Earth, it should make us consider the greatnesse of sinne, which moved the son of God not only to take our flesh, but to shed his blood also even for this <hi>hoc:</hi> That men would remember when they sin that they are about a <hi>hoc</hi> that brought all the curses which followed after; that therefore they should not make a light accompt of it, reckoning it a small matter, but to reckon of sinne as God, <hi>quare

                  </p>
                  <p>And as it serves by way of vehemencie, to aggravate the offence of the offence, so it serveth for distinction, As if God should say another thing, <hi>Thou hast done, but because thou hast done this,</hi> therefore the sentence is come upon thee, <hi>Thou thoughtest in thy self to make thy self equall with God, Isay</hi> 14. and because thou hast done that, that is come upon thee which Christ saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>Ever lasting fire is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thee:</hi> But now because thou wast not content with that, but hast mingled poyson, whereby thou hast venomed and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned others;
<hi>because thou hast been an homicide,</hi> for that is his second fault,
<hi>John</hi> 8. 44. there is thy punishment for doing this. Now we see the ground of Gods proceeding with him.</p>
                  <p>The sentence in it self consists of four parts which we reduce to<pb n="310" facs="tcp:62585:186"/>these two, one concerns himself, the other us: That which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects him is in this verse, that which concerns us is in the next: The first is threefold, First, <hi>That he is cursed above all Cattel, and above all the Beasts of the field.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That he shall goe and creep upon his belly.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>He shall eat the dust of the Earth:</hi> Wherein, as in the beginning generally, so here in special, you are to consider the Analogie of every part of his punishment. First, then he is
<hi>maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,</hi> and the reason is <hi>quia maledixerat, maledictio</hi> doth in justice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him, <hi>quia loquutus est malè,</hi> as you may see in the five verses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not that God had done it, but it came of himself, for he had defamed God, speaking evill of God; great reason it is then that evill speech should befall him: So there is an equality between the Devils sinne and his punishment. Now in regard of the second, which is in the 15. verse, <hi>That he should goe upon his bellie,</hi> for as much as he doth take upon him to exalt himself, <hi>Isay</hi> 14. And for that he tells <hi>Eve, If yee eat of it, eritis sicut Dii,</hi> therefore he is cast down: the proportion to him that will flie, is, by the contrary, to creep; not to goe on his leggs, but on his bellie: So the Serpent, because he would flie up into the highest place, is made to creep on his bellie; So the second part of the Sentence stands with equity: As also the third; for his temptation was, that they should eat of the forbidden fruit now <hi>cibi prohibita poena</hi> is, that he that lusts after that he should not eat, shall be forced to eat that he would not, as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith: In <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. they that long for meat which they ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, shall be punished with eating that which their soul most abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that is for the equity kept in the three branches of this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Serpent himself, In the first branch (which is,
<hi>thou art cursed</hi>) are two points very necessary to be considered: First, That God saith, <hi>Maledictus es,</hi> and not <hi>Maledictus sis,</hi> for thereby God plainly sheweth, that it comes not from him, but from the Serpent; for then he would have said, <hi>Maledictus sis,</hi> but it is
<hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus es,</hi> shewing that the Serpents curse comes from himself; So all the curses, miseries, and calamities of this world, and torments of the world to come, proceed not from him, but from himself, as <hi>Job</hi> calls them, <hi>sparks, Job</hi> 5. 7. So they are the very sparks of the fire of concupiscence, of sinne that is kindled in us; as also the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saith,
<hi>the fruit and crop of that seed of sinne is calamitie and miserie, Hos.</hi> 10. 13. which was, is, and ever shall be the fruit of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the <hi>Revenues of sinne, Prov.</hi> 12. 16. and <hi>the wages of sinne, Rom.</hi> 6. that is, there was an evill in him, first to speak evill of that partie in whom was noe evill, and so <hi>malum ad se malum trahit,</hi> one evil brings another, the Serpents evil speaking is the cause that evill is spoken of him; for that is it that makes the difference, as <hi>Pro.</hi> 26.
2. there is a curse that is causlesse, and that shall return upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as
<hi>Shemeis</hi> curse against <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. So should the curse of <hi>Balaam,</hi> if he had cursed the People of God; but he was wiser, and said, <hi>How shall I cursewhere the Lord blesseth?</hi> but it is otherwise<pb n="311" facs="tcp:62585:186"/>when <hi>Noah</hi> a just man

                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:62585:187"/>Thirdly, <hi>Maledictus prae,</hi> this curse takes deeper root in him than in any other Creature, as his evill is in a further manner in him than in any other; there is no beast doth that which he causeth man to doe; for there is no wrath in wilde beasts so malicious as in man, submitting himself to the pleasures of drunkennesse and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever sinne else; no beast will drink more than shall doe him good, nor be drunk as man, nay <hi>it is a shame to speak the things that are done of them in secret,</hi> by the instigation of Sathan and malice of the Devils wrath, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.
12. and the beasts never banded themselves together with weapons to fight as men doe, and they fight but with those weapons which nature yeelds them, but man hath devised Guns and Spears one to goare another; neither doe they give themselves wholly to all excesse, as man doth. This evil where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with man is infected by the Serpent is above that which is in bruit beasts, yea above all evil of Creatures, both wilde and tame: And it is said in that respect only, but in this also, that there is no beast of the field, nor Creature in Heaven or Earth, but keeps and continues in his first condition and estate wherein he was first created, but the Devill hath left his, and man, by the seducing of the Devil, hath lost his state also, and keepeth not his course in obeying his Maker, as all other Creatures doe, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. where a reason is rendred of it, and <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. Man is compared to the Beasts, yea
<hi>like Horse and Mule which understand not:</hi> If it be thus with beasts, then much more may man be ashamed, that hath reason and understanding, and yet committeth these things which bruit beasts refrain; and therefore when there is a comparison between man and the beasts, as <hi>Chrisostome</hi> saith,
<hi>Pejus est comparare bestiis quam nasci de bestiis;</hi> and that man that shall live so like a beast, is worse than he that is turned into a beast, as
<hi>Nebucodonoser.</hi> In these three respects he is cursed above all other.</p>
                  <p>The last point is that which the ancient Fathers set down upon this division, that God puts down and names both these beasts that man hath service of; and in beasts, those that he hath no use of, wilde beasts, as Tygres and Lyons, and such; and this degree saith <hi>Augustine,</hi> that the Devil translates himself into both names both shapes, which shews that the Devil can take either shape, and as we know in his livelie temples wherein he dwells, as Sorcerers and such, he shews himself sometime in them
<hi>Jumentum,</hi> a tame beast to help and serve man, as <hi>Acts</hi> 16. in the Maids possessed with a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Divination; and sometime he will be in them a roaring Lyon, to fear us: But in whether shape he appears, whether in Maids or Boyes, he is <hi>maledictu</hi> in both, for his intent in both is accursed, namely to seek our ruine and destruction; so that whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the condition or comparison, it is verefied in the Serpent <hi>above all other beasts.</hi>

<note place="margin">Her Sorrow.</note>First, hee will greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease her sorrowes; besides the sorrowes in conception and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth children, her sorrow is afterwards increased; many a woman breedeth and beareth her owne sorrow; she may beare her childe to misery, if shee see it beg it increaseth her sorrow; shee may beare it to execution, as wee have too many lamentable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xamples: but the sorrow of a mother is much more increased if it live so wickedly that shee beare it to hell fire.</p>
                  <p>For the sorrow of Child-bearing, in the Psalmes, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Prophets, the greatest sorrow is compared to a womans la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring with childe, which is so great that many a one dyeth of it, as did <hi>Rachell, Gen.</hi> 25. 18. never was childe borne without pain, according to that old verse,
<q>
                        <l>Nascitur haud sine vae, fuerit qui filius
<hi>Evae.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>But here God sheweth even in judgement his mercy; for shee sinned in soule, is punished but in body, and that punishment is temporary, though the sinne deserved death eternall; and which is further, there is a blessing even in this Sentence; for to have children (though with pain) is a great blessing, and by the ancient Fathers is called the blessing of the womb and brests: and barrennesse of woman is held a greater sorrow and payne, than to have children with much griefe and payne; for when the childe is once borne, the payne is forgotten, but barrennesse is to her a continual grief, in the 30 of <hi>Genesis vers.</hi> 1. When <hi>Rachell</hi> saw shee was barren, and <hi>Leah</hi> fruitfull, shee envied her sister, and so great was her desire of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that unlesse shee had children shee would die: So it is a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Justice mingled with Lenity, the punishment is not with

                     <note place="margin">2. The disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Act.</note>The other branch is the disordered act of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree of sinne; for to have heard the voice of his Wife, and there to have stayed and not to have sinned, had been worthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation: to have remembred the voice of God and not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the voice of <hi>Eve</hi> had been commendable: before he heareth the voice of God, but here he obeyeth the voice of <hi>Eve.</hi> Out of this act of sinne the Fathers gather two Circumstances; the first is, that the voice of God might easily have been obeyed; <hi>Of all the trees in the Garden thou maist eat, de illâ arbore, of that one tree alone thou shalt not eat:</hi> in such plenty one might have been forborn: so that great was the disobedience when so small a matter commanded by God was not obeyed by Man: according to that of <hi>St. Austin</hi> upon this place, <hi>Magna est iniquitas, ubi non magna obediendi difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas;</hi> here is great ingratitude, not to for bear this one having all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in aboundance. The Second Circumstance in this act of sin is to doe it though charge were given before to the contrary with pain of death, in the 17. of the former Chapter, It was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>he remembreth their obedience to be with fear and trembling:</hi> Not death shall separate
<hi>Paul</hi> from his obedience, but <hi>Adam</hi> was disobedient, though death were denounced, disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to death; so that the aggravating the act is the contempt of Gods denouncing of death and punishment. So much may suffice of the Fault.</p>

                  <p>I consider this Punishment of <hi>Adam</hi> after two sorts, either as a Sentence or as a Law. Now we will speak of it only as a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; hereafter, by Gods patience, we will handle the other as a Law. Herein we will consider the proportion of that Fault, with the Punishment, with the Fault, and with the Act it self: In the Sentence are two Punishments: The first,
<hi>cursed be the earth for thy sake,</hi> &amp;c. The second, <hi>in the sweat of labour shalt thou eat thy bread till thou return to dust, for dust thou art and to it shalt thou return:</hi> The<pb n="317" facs="tcp:62585:191"/>one part of the Punishment is a hard life, the other a corruption by death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In Proportion.</note>As <hi>Eves,</hi> so
<hi>Adams</hi> punishment is in proportion: First his desire was unlawfull and the Act was sin; for according to 1. <hi>of St. James</hi> 15. <hi>When lust conceiveth, it bringeth forth sinne; and sinne, when it is finished bringeth forth death: Eves</hi> lust made her sinne and she was punished: <hi>Adams</hi> neglect to suffer an Inferiour to prevail against God, is punished with labour, for labour is <hi>poena ignaviae,</hi> and Mans ingratitude to God is punishment with the Earths ingratitude to Man; he was disobedient, the earth shall be unfruitfull; he offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in meat, and he is punished in his meat; the earth that should feed him, is cursed for him; he offended in unkindness active, he is punished with unkindness passive; he dealt unkindly with God, he shall suffer the earths unkindness: <hi>Eve</hi> her punishment was in bringing forth life, Mans is in bringing forth living to maintain and nourish life, which is a great difficulty; both have their pain, labour, and sorrow: Hers is in intension, great but for a few houres; his is great in extension, to indure all the dayes of his life. And so much generally of the Punishment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In his meat.</note>Now in particular: the first part of mans Punishment is in his meat: Men must needs have whereof to eate, for life without living and maintenance will not be preserved: there is not only a bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of Children, but there are also <hi>curae oeconomicae,</hi> houshould cares: meat and cloathing must of necessity be had, according to that of the Wise man, <hi>Preacher</hi> 6. 7. <hi>all the labour of man is for his mouth,</hi> and the 16. of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> and the 26. is to like purpose: he must eat, and the hearb of the field must be his meat; fuell must maintain the fire, and meat must maintain life; <hi>Adam</hi> came of the earth and must live by the earth; the earth that was his Mother must be his Nurse, and from thence mankinde must be maintained, even all, the meanest and the Monarch; for as it is <hi>Preacher</hi> 5. 8. <hi>the aboundance of the earth is over all: the King consisteth by the field that is tilled.</hi> The hearb of the field &amp; bread was the only sustenance of the Patriarchs before the Flood, but after the waters had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by over much moisture the strength that was in hearbs and bread, God gave them then other meats &amp; drinks of strength, in the 9.

<hi>for thorns there grew firre trees, for nettles the myrrhe tree,</hi> as it is <hi>Isaiah</hi> 55. 13. then was the earth a kinde and fruitfull Mother, but by this course of mans disobedience the earth is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Step-mother, and without labour she yeeldeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Chapter, is here cursed for mans sinne, the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness must be recovered by mans labour; so that labour is a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the earths Curse:
<note place="margin">Three things in the Curse.</note>And in this Curse we observe these three things:
<note place="margin">First the earth cursed:</note>First the earth it self is cursed: In the 1. Chapter <hi>God said that the earth should yeeld hearbs with seed, and trees with fruit of it self, it was so:</hi> there was fertility and fecundity by Gods brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: that in the Scriptures is called <hi>a blessed field, wherein is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> If man had stood upright there should have been plenty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain taking; yet man should not have been idle, there should have been labour with pleasure, but sinne hath made it with pain. The staffe of bread should have indured; <hi>but God will break the staffe of their bread, Leviticus</hi> 26. 26. There shall be no more plenty but penurie; and of it self <hi>germinabit spinas &amp; tribulos, it shall bring forth weeds, thorns, and thistles, and in aboundance.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Secondly the Cause:</note>The second thing is the Cause of the Curse, <hi>for thy sake.</hi> In the 3. <hi>of Habakkuk</hi> 8. The question is, <hi>whether God were angrie against the Rivers, the Floods, and the Sea?</hi> as much to say they have not offended. Here the earth hath done no offence: it was not cursed for it self, <hi>non in se, sed prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter te in quantum maledicta fuit propter te:</hi> It is all one to the earth in regard of it self, whether it be barren or fruitfull, for when it doth fructifie it is not for it self: it is insensible of punishment, but it is all for mans sake. Man is as the great Sphear, the <hi>primum mobile</hi> to the other Creatures; his obedience to God drawes the obedience of Plants, Trees, Beasts, and all the Elements unto him

The originall world of mans integrity was a Mirrour, for the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers are of minde that the Sun was more clear, the waters more pleasant, the earth more fruitfull, all things more perfect; <hi>then all the trees of the field did clap their hands,</hi> as it is the fifty fifth of

                     <note place="margin">Thirdly, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor continued.</note>and this labour must be continued, which is the third thing; the continuance of it, which is of three forts. First, It is not simple labour for a day or two, but
<hi>cunctis diebus vitae,</hi> in youth and in age even to death, as it is in the nineteenth verse, <hi>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread till thou return to earth. St. Austin</hi> saith there is <hi>perpetu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> corruptio</hi> and <hi>perpetuus labor,</hi> sloth is punished with continuance of labour: in the second of
<hi>Samuell</hi> the eleventh chapter and second verse, thy idleneness fell to lust, and as it is in the first to <hi>Timothie</hi> the fifth and the thirteenth, idleness leadeth to all sinnes. Secondly, It is continued with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; what if thou labour and it bringeth forth <hi>spinas &amp; tribulos,</hi> thorns and thistles, yet must thou bear it, and labour still in the sweat of thy face? like him that planted a Vineyard with much pain and great cost, <hi>and he looked it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wilde grapes;</hi> and as it is in <hi>Psalm</hi> 127. <hi>the labour is in vain unless God blesse it:</hi> Plenty commeth not by mans labour but by Gods mercy: Vain therefore were they, the first of <hi>Habakkuk</hi> the fifteenth, <hi>That took fish with the angle and the net, and gathered it in their yarn; and when they had done, did sacrifice to their net and burned incense to their yarn, because by them they thought their portion was fat and their meat plentious:</hi> Their labour is even nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods blessing, lest as in that place of <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> they should deifie their own labour: though the earth be unkinde labour thou still, <hi>and boast not of thy labour lest it be vain.</hi> Thirdly, as it is in the 10. of the
<hi>Preacher</hi> the 10. <hi>If the Iron be blunt it must be whet to have an edge, and if need be of a better edge, then it must be whet with more strength:</hi> And here if great labour will not serve greater must be added, harder labour must be used, it must be <hi>labor sudoris;</hi> if thou wilt have hearbs for thy meat only smaler labour will serve, but if thou wilt feed upon bread, thou must use much labor, thou must labour and sweat; thy nutriment must be by an excrement, bread is the interest of thy continuall labour: this is the yoke of the sins of <hi>Adam.</hi> God in punishing the Israelites will remember the land which he gave them, <hi>Leviticus</hi> 26. 42. <hi>and they must suffer the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their iniquitie; yea, when you shall remember your own wickedness, yee shall judge your selves worthy destruction for your iniquitie,</hi> in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sixth of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and the thirty first:

                     <note place="margin">The use of the Scripture.</note>Now this sentence upon <hi>Adam</hi> hath this use for us,
<hi>spinae &amp; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli,</hi> the thorns and thistles when we walk in the field speak to us as Gods book doth, and make us a Sermon, telling they should not have grown there but for us, the earth should not have been cursed with barreness but for our wickedness: if the thorn prick; or the nettle sting thee, it will say <hi>hoc propter te;</hi> I was first brought and still I grow to make thee remember thy obedience; so that the very nettle that is good for nothing shall put thee in mind of thy

                     </gap>: Be not angrie with the earth if it be barren, for it will say it was so <hi>non propter se, sed propter te.</hi> To conclude this point well saith a Father, we must have not only
<hi>sensum poenae in corpore,</hi> the feeling of punishment in our body, but
<hi>sensum irae divinae in mente,</hi> the seeling of Gods wrath in our soul.</p>
                  <p>But now not to leave you plunged in despair with consideration of grievous punishment, in a word I will touch the alay of this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: be comforted, though God be just yet he is mercifull, <hi>non est Crux sine Christo,</hi> hast thou a Cross then hast thou Christ to comfort thee.
<note place="margin">Mercies in this Sentence are five.</note>God hath left five signes of his mercie in this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which the ancient Fathers term <hi>vestigia miserantis gratiae,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Gods mercifull favour.
<note place="margin">1.</note>The first is, <hi>non dixit maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus tu,</hi> cursed be thou, as he said to the Serpent, but <hi>terra maledicta,</hi> cursed be the earth: the nature that sinned is not cursed, nor is it like <hi>Cains</hi> curse in the fourth Chapter and eleventh verse, for there is he cursed from the earth; but here the earth of which <hi>Adam</hi> was made, not <hi>Adam</hi> himself was cursed.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, he is punished but with a little labour to his great sinne, with a watry drops of sweat, and the sweat is but an easie sweat of the face, not like Christs sweat in his prayer, the twenty second of <hi>Luke</hi> the fourty fourth verse, <hi>which was like drops of blood trickling down to the ground.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, God might have suffered the earth to have been fruitless let man have laboured never so much, but that man for all his sinne, yet with his labour shall make the earth fruitfull, in my opinion is a great mercy, which I ground out of the one hundred twenty eighth <hi>Psalme: when thou eatest the labour of thy hands,</hi> saith
<hi>David, thou shalt be blessed,:</hi> It is a blessing when <hi>the Wife is fruitfull as the Vine upon the house side, when thy Children are as the Olive plants about thy Table:</hi> and it is a blessing that yet with labour the earth shall bring forth fruit: It is a comfort <hi>that your labour shall not be in vain,</hi> as <hi>St. Paul</hi> speaketh, the first to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> the fifteenth and the fifty eighth. God in mercy sendeth rain to water the earth, what to doe? <hi>Isaiah</hi> telleth you in his 55. chapter and 10. verse, <hi>to give not only bread to the eater but even seed to the sower:</hi> It is a comfort when we sowe that we shall reap; <hi>he that soweth, eareth, reapeth, thresheth, doth it in hope,</hi> the first to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> the ninth chapter and tenth verse. God giveth bread to the hungry and the seed to further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease by labour, <hi>dat acquisitum,</hi> that thou hast gained through thy labor.
<note place="margin">4.</note>Fourthly, it is a great mercie to call it <hi>panis taus,</hi> thy bread, thou shalt eat of thy own bread; this is mercy, I say, to terme that<pb n="321" facs="tcp:62585:193"/>mans which is Gods. Lastly, this labour hath a date and an end, it hath <hi>tempus refrigerii; upon the amending your lives, God will put away your sinnes, and a time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord, Acts</hi> 3. 19.

2. <hi>The Law of life which is in Christ Jesus, hath freed me from the Law of sinne and of death,</hi> so that sinne is the cause of death. Hence sprung the Pelagian heresie; condemned by the Councell of <hi>Carthage:</hi>

<note place="margin">Death.</note>
                     <hi>That as by one mans disohedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one many were made righteous:</hi> and further, <hi>That as sinne reigned unto death, so grace by righteousnese might reign to eternall life.:</hi> Truth it is, that through sin came death, and that death hath rule over all; <hi>Adam</hi> at the first by sinne brought death, the last <hi>Adam</hi> by obedience brought ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life; and as <hi>Paul,</hi> in the first to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the fifteenth chapter and the twenty sixth verse, saith, <hi>That the last enemie that Christ should destroy was death;</hi> for as it is in the same chapter,
<hi>As in Adam all die, so in Christ all shall be made alive; and the very wages of sinne is death, but the gift of God is eternall life,</hi> saith
<hi>Paul</hi> in the sixth to the <hi>Romans</hi> and the twenty third verse.
<note place="margin">The nature and form of sinne.</note>Touching the nature and form of the sinne,
<note place="margin">God is not cause of sinne.</note>God is not the agent in sinne, but the cause of sinne is only from <hi>Adam</hi> himself. And according to that of the Wise man in his first chapter and thirteenth verse,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Adam</hi> and sin cause of death.</note>
                     <hi>God hath not made death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living;</hi> and in the eighteenth of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and the twenty third, <hi>God hath no desire that the wicked should die, but if even the wicked return from his waies he shall live:</hi> so that <hi>Adam</hi> and his sinne was the cause of death, death was<pb n="322" facs="tcp:62585:194"/>made by him, for God is the God of life. It was the sinne of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh</hi> that made God to threaten destruction to <hi>Nineveh</hi> within fourty dayes; but when, as it is in the third of <hi>Jonah</hi> and the eighth, they returned by repentance from their evill waies, God shewed mercie and they were not destroyed. <hi>Adam</hi> he forsook God of himself, and so he brought death to himself: So long as he shewed his obedience unto God, the other Creatures were obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto him, there was no enmity between him and the other Creatures; in time of obedience he was not in danger of death: God breathed into
<hi>Adam</hi> life, <hi>Adam</hi> brought death. The Prophet in the 104.
<hi>Psalme</hi> 29. saith, <hi>If thou take away their breath, they return to their dust;</hi> so that life is Gods, but dust is their own, ground and they have their moisture, and when that moisture is dried up and taken away it turneth to dust; <hi>ex argillâ fabricavit hominem Deus: Job</hi> in his tenth chapter and ninth verse saith to God, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou hast made me as the clay, and wilt thou bring me to dust again:</hi> for if the moisture of the grace of God be taken away, what are we but dust. The Heavens send down the dew from above to moisten the Earth, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 45. 8. <hi>It is the spirit of God that giveth the moisture to beliefe, John</hi> 7. 39. If that be taken away we are but dust. Thus farre of it as a Sentence.</p>

                     <note place="margin">A Law.</note>Now of this as of a Law:
<note place="margin">To dust shalt thou return.</note>First touching the certainty of it in these words, <hi>to dust thou shalt return;</hi> of the uncertainty when, <hi>donec,</hi> untill. There are those that escape the first part of this punishment of <hi>Adam,</hi> that live not in the sweat of their face, <hi>qui non vivunt ex labore sudoris,</hi> there are those that live at ease and yet fare daintily, that have aboundance and take no pains, <hi>that lie upon their Beds as the door turneth upon his hinges, Proverbs</hi> 26. 14. But though they escape that part of the Sentence, this part takes hold of all, for all must die; this is universall this is certain <hi>Statutum est,</hi> it is a Statute and a Law that all must die, from the first to the last <hi>Adam,</hi> the fift to the <hi>Romans</hi> the fifteenth. <hi>David</hi> himself saith of himself in regard of mortalitie of the body, <hi>Psalme</hi> the twenty second and the sixth, <hi>I am a worm and not a man.</hi> We have comfort in Jesus Christ to live for ever: this was it that Jesus said, <hi>that John should not die,</hi> the twenty first of
<hi>John</hi> and the twenty third, and by him we look for the resurection of the body. This it was that made <hi>Job,</hi> in his nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter and twenty sixth verse, to say <hi>That though after my skin wormes destroy this body, yet shall I see God in my flesh.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A universall Law.</note>Touching the extent of this, that it is universall to all to die, it is plain not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; for as it is in the eighty ninth <hi>Psame</hi> and the fourty eighth verse:
<hi>What man liveth and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the grave?</hi> Though God hath said to Kings and Princes and Judges of the earth, yee are Gods and Children of the Almighty, yet yee shall die as men and fall like others, <hi>Psalme</hi> the eighty second and the seventh, <hi>laquei mortis, the snares of death compass about the Godly; their body goeth to the grave, but their soul returneth to rest, Psalme</hi> the one hundred sixth and the seventh verse; and as it is in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond<pb n="326" facs="tcp:62585:194"/>of the
<hi>Preacher</hi> and the sixteenth, <hi>The wise man dieth as well as the fool:</hi> Look what sentence is given upon man, falls upon the rest of the Creatures, for man is the great Count-palatine of the world, and the chief mover in the Sphear; as he moveth all are moved, and the Elements, and Birds, and Beasts were subject to Mans change; his disobedience made all disobedient and out of order; yea as the Wise-man saith in the nineteenth of

This time cannot be discerned, it is nighest us when we think our selves most secure: <hi>For when the rich man had layed up store for many years, and said to his soul take thou thy rest, even then came it, hâc nocte, this night thou shalt die.</hi> Death is pronounced upon all, <hi>but a flaming fire and vengeance belongeth only to the ungodly,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> the first chapter and the eighth and ninth verses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Mercy in death</note>Now touching the mittigation of this death in this sentence of death; for as the Wise-man speaketh in the seventh chapter and the seventeenth verse <hi>The vengeance of the wicked is fire and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<note place="margin">The fear of death.</note>
                     <hi>Christ delivereth them from the fear of death</hi> (that is Gods anger) <hi>that all their life were subject to bondage,</hi> the second to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and the fifteenth:
<note place="margin">The hope of life.</note>so then the fear of death must be alayed with the hope of life. <hi>For though the wicked be cast off for his malice, yet the righteous hath hope in his death;</hi> the fourteenth of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> and the thirty second. This is joy to us even in death, <hi>that Christ will change this vile body, that it may be fashioned like his glorious body,</hi> the third to the <hi>Philipians</hi> and the twenty first, and according to the fourteenth of the <hi>Revelations</hi> and the thirteenth, their hope is with a blessing; <hi>beati mortui qui in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino moriuntur, blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, for they rest from their laboures.</hi> Now in the verie words of the Sentence are implied two sorts of this delay:
<note place="margin">

<hi>tempus est refrigerii, there is a time of refreshing,</hi> the third of the
<hi>Acts</hi> and the nineteenth. They that live in ease are weary of it:
<hi>Salomon,</hi> in the first of the <hi>Kings</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter and the fourth verse, died in his age. <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the twenty fifth of
<hi>Genesis</hi> and the eighth, <hi>yeelded the spirit and died a good age;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Death is a resting from Labour and from sinne.</note>and death is not only a resting from labour, but from sinne also.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:62585:195"/>
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> in the seventh to the <hi>Romans</hi> and the twenty fourth, <hi>desireth to be delivered from the body of sinne, which he calleth the body of death.</hi> The holy Fathers on that place; but this difference, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs desire to die that they might not sinne, the Malefactors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have sinned.</p>

                     <hi>ADam</hi> here calleth his Wife by a new name, not by the former name in the 23. of the former, which was Woman.

                  <p>Herein we will consider these two things, first the imposition of a name, and then of this name. For the first, the imposing of names is an argument of superiority and power: in the 19. of the former chapter it is shewed, in the naming of all the Creatures by man, which names were properly given by him. In the thirty fifth chapter and the eighteenth verse, <hi>Jacobs Wife before her death called her sonnes name Ben-oni, but his Father changed that name and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him Benjamin,</hi> from the sonne of sorrow to the sonne of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now then touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the imposition of this name, wherein wee will consider the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of this name, and then the qualitie thereof.

Zathaca,</hi> this name belongeth to all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, in respect of this life, for all bring forth life, though to die.<pb n="328" facs="tcp:62585:197"/>It only this life were here regarded, the ancient Fathers that came from her, though they lived long, yet they died and have long layn dead, and in regard of the length of their death, shee might have beene called the mother of the dead, therefore this name is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the other life which is eternall, for after death they had hope of another life. <hi>David</hi> in the twenty seventh
<hi>Psalme</hi> and the thirteenth verse, <hi>Should have sainted but that hee beleeved to see the goodnesse of God in the land of the living.</hi> And in the hundred forty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Psalme</hi> and the fifth verse, <hi>hee had his portion and hope in the land of the living.

                  <p>Now where there is a Commandement or Promise of life, there is meant eternall life: <hi>Hee that doeth the Commandements shall live,</hi> not a mortall but an immortall life, the Covenant of life to the Priests and People in the Leviticall law is that life: That was it that made <hi>Job</hi> in his ninteenth chapter and twenty fifth verse, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure himselfe <hi>that his Redeemer lived, and so should hee;</hi> but most plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaketh Christ himselfe, the eleventh of <hi>John</hi> and the twenty fifth verse, of himselfe; <hi>that hee is life, and hee that beleeveth in him though hee mere dead yet shall hee live,</hi> and in the very nature of the word it selfe is a double being, the one temporall, the other perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, which is expressed in the originall by difference of one letter, <hi>Hagab</hi> and <hi>Havah,</hi> all have the common life, but there are those <hi>that are strangers from the life of God,</hi> the fourth of the <hi>Ephesians</hi> and the eighteenth verse, and there are those <hi>to whom God is life and length of dayes,</hi> the thirtith of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> and the twentith verse, so that not by consequence, but by the very essence of this name is meant life eternall;
<hi>God hath his booke where hee writeth the living,</hi> the thirty second chapter of <hi>Exodus</hi> and the thirty second verse, <hi>there is a booke of life,</hi> the sixty ninth <hi>Psalme</hi> and the twenty ninth verse. <hi>God promiseth to give to him that overcommeth, to eate of the Tree of Life,</hi> the second of the <hi>Revelations</hi> and the seventh verse, and the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon that place, <hi>non dedit corollam, sed coronam vitae,</hi> he gave a crown of life, which is life for ever.</p>
                  <p>There is a mysterie also in the qualitie of the name, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the word it selfe, which is a bringing of good news and glad tidings; as are cold waters to comfort the thirstie, so is good news from a farre Country, the twenty fifth chapter of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> and the twenty fifth verse; <hi>When</hi> Jacob <hi>heard that</hi> Joseph <hi>his sonne was yet alive, in a farre and strange Countrey, and that they had brought him Chariots, these tydings revived</hi> Jacob <hi>that was in age,</hi> the fourty fifth chapter and the twenty seventh verse; this name of life is even as a name of joyfull tydings; If in matters of this life it bee so, then much more in things spirituall, after wee have sinned and deserved punishment, then absolution and remission is a joying of a mans heart, and there is joy in this name, that word is life, <hi>&amp; vita est ex verbo,</hi> man at the first
<hi>was made a living soule,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of the former chapter.

                  <p>To begin then in order:
<note place="margin">1.</note>Out of the persons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> we learn, that though they were sinners yet God gave them his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and provision: <hi>The Sun shineth on the good and on the bad, the rain falleth on the just and the unjust,</hi> the fifth of <hi>Maithew</hi> and the fourty fifth, <hi>he is kinde nnto the unkinde,</hi> in the sixth of

It is said in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that God builded an house, it is not meant that he was a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, and here it is to be understood not that God was their Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, but that God gave them power to kill beasts, and capacity to make and shape apparrell; he was not the Workman himself.

The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reason why God made them apparrel, was for defence both of the cold of
<hi>Winter</hi> and the heat of <hi>Summer,</hi> to save them from the weather.
<hi>St. Paul,</hi> in the second to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the eleventh chapter and the twenty seventh verse, among other mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries rekoneth <hi>cold and nakedness;</hi> and as it is in the fifth of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations</hi> and the tenth, the Prophet speaketh <hi>heat maketh the skin black as an oven,</hi> so these clothes defended the skin from the offence of all weather; <hi>For in nature every one nourisheth and cherisheth his own flesh,</hi> the fifth to the
<hi>Ephesians</hi> and the twenty nineth; he nourisheth his belly with meat and cherisheth his back with clothes. <hi>We doe account our selves debters to the flesh;</hi> the eighth to the <hi>Romans</hi> and the twelfth, <hi>These two are meant by things needfull for the body,</hi> the second of <hi>St. James</hi> Epistle and the sixteenth; but as it is in the thirteenth of the
<hi>Romans</hi> and the fourteenth; <hi>Put you on the Lord Jesus, and take no thought for the flesh; facere &amp; non perficere,</hi> were vain to make a Creature and not to preserv it, God will not: but here we must learn to take heed that we make it a defence for necessity, and not an offence for superfluity, the first of <hi>James</hi> and the twenty first.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4. Of Skins.</note>The fourth point is, that this apparell was made of skins: Herein are two things to be learned; first that they were skins of beasts, and then that the beasts were destroyed: the beast was made to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, but man was to be regarded: they must die that man may be preserved from death; God hath greater regard of us than of all the beasts; <hi>we are of more value than many Sparrowes,</hi> the tenth of
<hi>Matthew</hi> and the thirty first: he is allowed here to kill beasts for his apparrell, and after to make their Tents of skins: <hi>God hath given us more understanding than the beasts, and more wisedome than the fowles of Heaven,</hi> the thirty fifth of <hi>Job</hi> and the eleventh The second thing is the quality of the apparrell, which is the first that God gave to Man, which they weare for his liverie; they are coverings of great frugality; they are unlike unto ours which are for shew and not for durance. It had been as easie for God to have made them of Silk and of Wool, But God regarded not the gorgeous shew. This simplicity of apparrell confoundeth the multiplicity of appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell in these daies, which they may well call a world of apparrell: The gorgeous attire of the daughters of <hi>Zion,</hi> the third of <hi>Isaiah</hi> and the sixteenth, shall be altered to beggerie, so that they shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their secret parts. Here apparrell was made for the body, but we make apparrell for apparrell, vail upon vail: the frugality confoundeth the riotousness and madness of apparrell, and this simplicity our sumptuosness: we are ashamed of

                     <note place="margin">5. <hi>Adam</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</note>The fifth point and last is, <hi>Adam</hi> looked not scornfully upon his apparel, but was content with it, which few of his posterity are; for still, though it be never so well, yet one way or other they still mislike: that is the first. Secondly, We must think well of such as weare such simple skinnes, and not account vilie of them for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such apparel: For those that went up and down in Sheeps skins and Goats skins, were such <hi>quibus non dignus erat mundus,</hi> of whom the world was not worthy, the eleventh to the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> the thirty seventh: <hi>But he,</hi> in the sixteenth of
<hi>St. Luke,</hi> the tenth verse, <hi>that fared daintily, that was elothed in purple and fine linnnen every day,</hi> for all this he was not worthy of the world. <hi>Salomon</hi> in his <hi>Canticles</hi> saith, <hi>That the Kings daughter is beautifull within,</hi> God respecteth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heart more than the outward shew, the glory of apparel of gold, or such like; <hi>But if the hid man of the heart be uncorrupt, and a spirit of humility before God,</hi> is a thing much more set by, the first of <hi>Peter</hi> the third chapter and the fourth verse. Now we desire to be like golden sepulchres; if the out side be gorgeous we care not how foul and filthy the inside is: well therefore say the Fathers, that <hi>nimia cura corporis ducit incuriam animae;</hi> too much care of the body causeth the carelesnesse of the soul. Secondly, They came hereby into Gods favour, by wearing his liverie they became his servants, and so of his houshold: They are of the Princes house, to whom he giveth bread and cloathing, the third of <hi>Esay</hi> and the sixt verse; If they were Gods servants, then God was their Master, and so it is said, the sixt to the
<hi>Ephesians</hi> the ninth, that the Master of us all is in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Out of these five clauses, for things corporal, we learn that out<pb n="334" facs="tcp:62585:200"/>devising, without Gods making, cannot stand, but is vain; that God regardeth us more than all the beasts he had made; he preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth our life, though by their death; hence we may learn frugali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to flie vanity; we may learn contentment and hate of pride; hence we may learn that apparel was first instituted to cover lust, not to provoke it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Spiritual use.</note>And further than these literal points we may gather not only a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily use, but also a spiritual instruction: He might have taken the hair of the Cammel, or the wooll of the Sheep, but the covering him with skinnes doth teach him humility to exalt him to glorie; hence then may we gather matter of repentance and of humilitie; hereby he hath to deject him in four regards, the first is, That by sinne he lay open, in that he was after thus covered, it put him in minde of his sinne, though it was seemly to cover his shame; for to cover a starre or the Sunne is a blemish to either; a Rose or a Lilie are best uncovered in their proper natures: and so <hi>Adams</hi> nakedness in his innocencie was best without apparel, <hi>The just man shall shine like the Sunne in the Kingdome of his father,</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>Matthew</hi> the fourty third verse. The second regard out of this covering or clothing is, That the birds are covered with their own feathers, the beasts with their haire and wooll, but man must die for nakednesse, unlesse he hath his cloathing from others. Thirdly, Goe to the brute beasts, and wear their skinnes, and by looking on them learn that if thou hadst been obedient, thou hadst not need of such clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and repeat that of the fourty ninth <hi>Psalm</hi> the twentieth verse, <hi>Man was in honour and understood it not, and now he is become like beasts that perish.</hi> Lastly, From the beasts being slain, To put him in minde that though he may preserve his bodie for a while, yet in the end <hi>in pulverem revertêris?</hi> though these must die to feed and cloath thee, yet in the end thou must die thy self.

                     <note place="margin">The form of the words.</note>Now for the matter conteined herein, the ancient Fathers doe gather hence,
<note place="margin">Matter of faith.</note>first matter of faith, <hi>quasi unus ex nobis, Adam</hi> is like one of us; hereby is taken a certain apprehension of the Trinity, to refute the Jews, that God speaketh not as Princes doe, and like Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, <hi>We charge you, It is our pleasure,</hi> &amp;c. that though he be one that speaketh, yet he useth the plurall number: but this doth resute them; for what Prince or Monarch saith <hi>Like one of us,</hi> to shew the unity of Godhead and trinity of persons; he said not like unto An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, but <hi>like one of us:</hi> In which words he sheweth both a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance or token of the unity and the Trinity, in the fourth of
<hi>John</hi> the twenty third verse, <hi>the person of the Father;</hi> in the twenty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth verse there following the person of the Sonne saith, <hi>I am he:</hi> So that in <hi>one</hi> is the Godhead, in <hi>us</hi> is the persons. So much of the character.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ironie.</note>Secondly, It may seem God speaketh this as an Ironie, in a scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sort; for surely it cannot be spoken directly, for he is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like <hi>God that knoweth all things,</hi> but rather <hi>like the brute beast with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out understanding;</hi> he is become by his disobedience liker the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that seduced him, than God that made him.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sarcasmus.</hi>
                     </note>Some take them as Ironicall, or which is more, as a <hi>Sarcasmus</hi> or biting speech,
<hi>Behold, they are as God,</hi> they would have a quaternity instead of a trinity, they know both good and evill: in the first of the <hi>Kings</hi> the eighteenth and the twenty seventh, <hi>Eliah</hi> mocketh the Priests of
<hi>Baal,</hi> saying, <hi>Cry aloud, for he is a God, it may be he sleepeth, and must be awaked:</hi> surely this was a scoffing speech: Hitherto apply the first to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> the twelfth chapter the thirty first verse.
<hi>Salomon,</hi> in the first of his <hi>Proverbs</hi> the twenty second verse, saith <hi>the Scorner taketh pleasure in scorning;</hi> so doth not God: yet in the twenty sixt verse of the same chapter, <hi>Because you have despised my counsell and not regarded my correction, I will laugh at your destruction, and mock when your fear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth:</hi> and yet surely this speech is not altogether without an Ironie, though it be not altogether Ironicall, for according to that of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> before cited, God scorneth them that scorne and despise him: but it is unusual, and not to be shewed in any one part of the Scriptures, that God useth scorning to the penitent sinner, though to the obstinate, whom neither love of mercy nor fear of punishment can draw to repentance. So then this speech is not a triumphing over them in miserie, or a derision of their simplicitie, but rather a publishing or laying open of their sinne by <hi>Ecce, behold. Jacob,</hi> in the thirty second of <hi>Genesis</hi> the thirty second verse, though he wrestled with the Angell and had a blessing, yet the sinew of <hi>Jacobs</hi> thigh shrank.
<note place="margin">A speech of affection.</note>This speech of God here is with an affection, it is the speech of affection, an unperfect speech without a period, it<pb n="337" facs="tcp:62585:203"/>breaketh off before it be full, like that speech of our Saviour Christ, the nineteenth of <hi>Luke</hi> the fourty second verse, <hi>Oh if thou haddest known, at the least in this thy day, those things which belong unto thy peace, but now are they hid from thee;</hi> affection stayeth the course of the speech, it is a speech of commiseration, <hi>ecce homo:</hi> pitie breaketh off the period. In the nineteenth of <hi>John</hi> the fist verse, when Christ was shewed to the People crowned with a crown of thornes <hi>Pilate</hi> said, <hi>Ecce homo, Behold the man:</hi> And <hi>Austin,</hi> upon that place, saith they are words of commiseration, and why are not the very same words here also? So much for the character or form of the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The matter in them.</note>Now of the matter of the same. It was concupiscence, desire of honor, beleef of error, <hi>that they should be as God,</hi> that made them sinne. The Serpent promised them that they should not dye at all, and that they should be as Gods, <hi>eritis sicut Dei:</hi> they heard the voice of the Devill and obeyed him. Now remember that promise of the Devill is false; hereafter beleeve me and be not deluded by the Devil: So that God giveth them an audible word to ring in their eares in this, and a lesson to continue in their heart for ever, that so he may say with

<hi>They were sent to the Earth from Paradise.</hi> To live then in the Earth, is the state of us all, yet we had no experience with <hi>Adam</hi> of this blessed state of Paradise; but they had tryall and experience of all the pleasures of Paradise, so much more penall was it to them to be deprived of a garden, of a garden of Gods own plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, full of all variety and contentment, of a garden, the like where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all the cunning and travail of man shall never make, and to come from thence to a ground untilled, barren, and full of thistles; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he that had lived before at ease must now be the tiller himself, for it shall not be tilled nor dressed to his hand. God dealt not here with <hi>Adam</hi> as he dealeth with the Children of Israel; He brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them from capativity to <hi>a Land filled with Cities which they builded not, full of goods which they brought not, of wells which they digged not, vineyards &amp; olive trees which they planted not, Deut.</hi> 6. 11. There is a great difference from the sending them to a land so dressed and provided, and to a place shall bear naught but thistles and thornes, which with all his labor and travail he shall not recover to the least part of the excellencie of this garden. If <hi>Adam</hi> had been sent to a place where fruit had grown without labor, or fruitfull with labour, it had been somewhat; but he is sent to the Earth cursed before by God in the seventeenth verse, from a place fully blessed, from a garden to the ground, from pleasure to labour.</p>

The second use is the Justification of Gods righteousnesse and equity. Man was not a native of Paradise, he was a stranger, he was not borne there; for God took him elsewhere and put him into this Garden at the first, the fifteenth of the former chapter, He was brought from the Earth and put here: And again here <hi>non est sumptus unde missus,</hi> but <hi>missus unde sumptus,</hi> he is not taken from whence he was sent, but tent to the Earth from whence he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; He was brought I say to Paradise, not made there; for this Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> was given him to take all pleasure and full use of it, at the first upon a condition he should keep Gods Commandement in the seventeenth of the former: but he brake the Law of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; and therefore, according to his just demerrits, <hi>he is sent to Earth from whence he was taken,</hi> and this answereth with Gods truth and his Justice.

That we may conclude then, that God hath sufficiently fenced this passage, with his Angell thus armed with a burning Sword: the very Asse which is of least understanding, feared the Angell armed with a drawn Sword and perceived it before <hi>Balaam,</hi> but to be armed with Fire it is more fearfull than with a Sword, for many a one would run upon a Sword that by all means would shun the Fire, look what scapeth the sword shall be devoured by the fire, and the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon <hi>Job.</hi> 22. 20.

                  <note place="margin">February 7 1598.</note>THIS continuance of the story of <hi>Moses</hi> begins to set forth the increase of the world, after <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were expelled <hi>Paradise.</hi> The sum of all set downe in this Chapter to that end, is of two parts. First, the propagation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. Secondly, the partition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, set out in
<hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abell.</hi> The propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is the fulfilling of that Prophesie of <hi>Adam,</hi> who foretold of his wise that she should be,
<hi>mater viventium,</hi> in the third chapter and the tewentith verse, and it is indeed a resemblance of the tree of life, in that by means hereof, albeit life cannot continue in any singular person because of the Sentence pronounced by God, <hi>that as hee is dust, so shall heereturne to dust,</hi> Chapter the third; yet there is <hi>immortalitas speciel,</hi> that is, a perpetuall succession of life in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of <hi>Adam:</hi> As a Tree, albeit in the end of the yeere it casts his leaves, yet still there remaines a substance of life in it, which makes it send forth leaves again, <hi>Esay</hi> the sixt and the thirteenth verse, so it is in mankinde; for as the old life falls, so there riseth up a new. When the Father dieth, the Child stands up in his place, and so is life still preserved. This is done by generation, which is a kinde of creation; as it is said of <hi>Adam, that he begat a Child in his own likeness, after his Image, Genesis</hi> the fifth and the third verse: For as there is in God <hi>diffusiva virtus,</hi> whereby he communicateth his goodnesse to others; so it is a thing to bee desired, that <hi>Adam</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received life should shew the same to others; that when <hi>Adam</hi> dyeth
<hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abell</hi> issued up in his stead, which desire is so planted in man, that albeit God when he said to <hi>Adam, that in sorrow and the sweat of his browes he should eate his owne bread,</hi> told him, that hee should have enough to doe to get a living for himselfe; yet <hi>Adam</hi> being scarce able to provide for himselfe, begetteth children; And
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:62585:213"/>albeit God said unto the woman <hi>that shee should bring forth children in sorrow and travell, Genesis</hi> the third Chapter and the sixteenth <hi>verse,</hi> yet shee not only brings forth <hi>Cain,</hi> but having tryed the paine of child-bearing, shee said not as <hi>Rebecca, Genesis</hi> the twenty fift <hi>Chapter</hi> and the twenty second
<hi>verse,</hi> but addeth yet and brings forth <hi>Abell,</hi> so high a reckoning did <hi>Adom</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> make of continuing their kinde:</p>
               <p>In the propagation we have two parts. First, <hi>Adams</hi> knowing: And secondly, <hi>Eves</hi> conception, unto which two things are to be added: first the manner of expressing the carnall copulation of
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> by this terme of [<hi>knowledg.</hi>]
<note place="margin">Afterward.</note>Secondly the circumstance of time, noted in the word [<hi>afterward.</hi>] For <hi>Adams</hi> knowledg, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of mankinde, wee see that the transgression of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, in <hi>Paradise,</hi> doth not hinder marriage, so as it should be a sinne to beget children; but contrary wise marriage is a remedy against sinne, the first of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the seventh
<hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and the second <hi>verse.</hi> And that which God affirmeth touching the joyning of man and woman, <hi>Genesis</hi> the second
<hi>Chapter</hi> and the twenty fourth <hi>verse, That Man shall leave father and mother and cleave to his wife, and they two shall bee one flesh,</hi> is not repealed by God; for wee see the accord of marriage betweene <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they company together and bring forth children. And as the estate of marriage was not taken away by sinne, so was not the blessing of fruitfullnesse and conception: Therefore, as before they fell, God said <hi>Bring forth fruit and multiply, and fill the Earth,</hi> the first
<hi>Chapter</hi> and the twenty eighth <hi>verse,</hi> so here <hi>Eve</hi> receiveth from the Lord strength to conceive and bring forth <hi>Cain</hi> and
<hi>Abell.</hi> Now the woman bringeth forth not only a seede, but the seede promised in the third chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> and the fifteenth verse,
<hi>and that a holy seede, Matthew</hi> the second chapter and fifteenth verse, not only Men in Earth, but Saints in Heaven; and the end hereof is, not only that wee should desire to have our own names continue, but as <hi>Joshua</hi> speakes in the seventh of <hi>Joshua</hi> and the ninth verse, <hi>quid fiet magno tuo nomine,</hi> that is, that not only wee may magnifie Gods name while wee live, but that when wee fall, another seede may stand up and prayse his name, that the seede may serve him, <hi>Psalme</hi> the twenty second and the thirtith verse, <hi>A people that shall bee borne shall praise him,</hi> the hundred and second <hi>Psalme</hi> and the eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse.
<note place="margin">Know.</note>Touching the carnall copulation of
<hi>Adam</hi> with <hi>Eve,</hi> where God expresseth it by the terme of
[<hi>knowledge</hi>] it sheweth us the holinesse of this tongue wherein the holy-Ghost writ this, then which there is no tongue that useth so modest and chaste speeches, and therefore is called the holy tongue, and it withall sheweth us, that the holy-Ghost, by his owne example, commendeth unto us modesty and chaste speeches, for that modest speech which hee u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth here to expresse the company of man and woman, he useth also <hi>Matthew</hi> the first, where he saith <hi>Joseph knew not Mary,</hi> and this thing hee calleth by another terme, <hi>Debitam benevolentiam,</hi> I <hi>Corinthians</hi>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:62585:213"/>the seventh and the third verse, that is, he exhorteth us
<hi>to avoid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, uncleaness, and filthiness, Ephesians</hi> the fifth and the third verse, so he might provoke us by his example: for as that broad speech uttered by <hi>Saul,</hi> was after the Lords spirit was taken from him, and another evill spirit vexed him; so unclean speeches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not from the holy Ghost, that delighteth in modest termes.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Again, the term of knowledge is used as opposite to passion, to teach men that they must dwell with their wives as men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the first of <hi>Peter</hi> the third and the seventh verse,
<hi>that they be not like fed horses, neighing after their neighbours wives, Jeremiah</hi> the fift chapter, and the eighth verse:
<note place="margin">Afterward.</note>The circumstance of time, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the word <hi>Afterward;</hi> That is, not before he was deprived of Paradise, but when he was driven out. For the pleasure of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is a mortall pleasure; For as Christ saith, <hi>In this world men mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but they that shall be counted worthie of the life to come, neither mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nor are given in marriage, but are as the Angells of God, Luke,</hi> the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth chapter. The use of marriage is, that because men die, they should beget sonnes, and leave a posterity to stand up after them: But the Children of the Resurrection dye as men, and therefore he was made to beget Children. And, for spirituall joy or comfort it is none; But <hi>postquam spiritus deficit, venium ad solatia carnis.</hi> It is a carnall pleasure: For as <hi>Cain</hi> being cursed out of Gods City, built himself a City, in the fourth chapter of <hi>Genesis:</hi> As
<hi>Saul</hi> being cast out of the Lords favour, would be honoured of man, in the first of <hi>Samuell</hi> fift chapter; So <hi>Adam</hi> being deprived of spirituall comfort and pleasure, useth marriage as a carnall pleasure.

Contrary works.</note>Secondly, As they have diverse dispositions; so their works are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: For, as the Apostle saith of <hi>Ismael</hi> and <hi>Isaac, Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>He that was borne after the flesh, persecuted him that was borne after the Spirit:</hi> So did
<hi>Cain</hi> persecute <hi>Abell,</hi> as the Apostle witnesseth,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. that <hi>Cain was of that wicked One, and slew his Brother;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why <hi>Cain</hi> slew
<hi>Abell.</hi>
                  </note>And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evill, and his Brothers good: So as their dispositions were diverse, their works were contrary: So in <hi>Cain</hi> there is a resemblance of all the persecutors and oppressors, that have been in the world:
<note place="margin">The Wicked persecute the Godly by hand and tongue.</note>And <hi>Abell</hi> is a pattern of all the Martyrs, that have been slain by the hand of <hi>Cain,</hi> or wounded and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the tongue of <hi>Ismael,</hi> who by mocking persecuted <hi>Isaac,</hi> in the fourth chapter to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> In these two is fulfilled that envy which God proclaimed between the woman and the Serpent, and between their seeds, <hi>Genesis</hi> the third and the fifteenth verse, <hi>who was not only of the seed of that evill one, Joshua</hi> the first and the third verse, that was of the Serpent: and the reason why the name of <hi>Cain</hi> is set down in the Bible, is, to shew the performance of that Prophesie, <hi>Genesis</hi> the third and the fifteenth verse, <hi>and to shew his wrath upon the Vessels of wrath, Romans</hi> the ninth and the twenty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, such as was <hi>Cain, Cham, Pharoah,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> and all the wicked ones of his Race, for the order of their comming into the world, as <hi>Cain</hi> who was first born, was worst, and <hi>Abell</hi> the <pb n="367" facs="tcp:62585:214"/>last born, was best; so it is with all mandkind: For as the Apostle saith, <hi>first commeth that which is naturall, and then that which is spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> the first to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the fifteenth chapter and the fourty sixt verse;
<note place="margin">1. We possesse an evill minde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a good.</note>so first we are possessed with an evill minde, before we can have a good minde. First <hi>Cain</hi> was born, after he begat <hi>Enoch,</hi> and then <hi>Tubalcain,</hi> then followes <hi>Lamech,</hi> and at last
<hi>Enosh</hi> a good man; so God saith, there is first <hi>the root of bitterness planted in our hearts, Deutcronomie</hi> the twenty ninth and the eighteenth verse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can be rooted in saith well, <hi>Colossians</hi> the first chapter, that <hi>we are first wild olives, and must be ingrasted into the true Olive, Romans</hi> the eleventh. Nature doth not well at the first, but is first inclined to evill, till it please God to give grace: And whereas <hi>Cain</hi> had <hi>Abell</hi> for his Brother, so we learn that the Companions and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren of all worldly possessions, <hi>is vanity and vexation;</hi> first, in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, then in keeping, and lastly in losing them.
<note place="margin">And in Riches are thorns and cares.</note>When we finde that in riches there are thorns and pricking cares, <hi>Luke</hi> the eighth,
<note place="margin">Riches and Greife are Bretheren.</note>that riches and grief are bretheren, then there is a way to grace. If we speak of them severally: To begin with <hi>Cain,</hi> in that which <hi>Eve</hi> speaks of him, I have purchased a man of God. There is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be commended, and also somewhat to be blamed: That which deserves commendation is of two sorts. First, her thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and consession which she makes after her deliverie; for she a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes it not to her self, or her husband, nor to the strength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<note place="margin">Children come by Gods grace and blessing.</note>that she had brought forth a Sonne, but that he came by the grace of God, wherein she doth as much as God requireth to be done by women that come to be purified, <hi>Leviticus</hi> the twelfth where he took order,
<note place="margin">Our duty is thankfulnesse to God.</note>that in token of thankfulness to God, <hi>who had preserved them, they should offer:</hi> And it is as much as <hi>David</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, <hi>Psalme</hi> the one hundred twenty seventh, <hi>that Children and the fruit of the wombe are a blessing that commeth from the Lord.</hi> Secondly, if it be meant that she had obteined a man for God, as some will have it to be expounded; for thereby she declared her joy, to be chiefly in that she had a Sonne; not only to fill the earth, and to serve for <hi>Adam</hi> when he was dead; but one that should serve God, and magnifie his name when they were dead; whereas she called her first sonne by a name that did set out Gods goodness, and the second by a name that shewed mans vanity and miserie, that is, to be commended;
<note place="margin">In miserie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider Gods goodnesse, and why so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note>for we must consider Gods goodness with our miserie, left we be driven to despair; and when we behold Gods goodness, we must joyn the consideration of our miserie, left we wax proud and forget our selves. But in that whereas she thought she had <hi>that seed which God promised should break the Serpents head,</hi> in the third chapter of <hi>Genesis:</hi> therein she is to be blamed; for albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it her faith is to be commended, because she beleeved that promise;
<note place="margin">What defect of Faith is.</note>yet her defect of faith is to be blamed, in the 1. Epistle to the <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> the third chapter &amp; the tenth verse; that defect was, that she made too much haste for the peformance of the promise. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saith of the true faith,
<hi>Qui crediderit non festinat,</hi> in the 28.<pb n="368" facs="tcp:62585:215"/>chapter of <hi>Isaiah:</hi> But she maketh too much haste; for the promise is not made of the seed of the first woman; therefore this was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of saith to be blamed in her. That there was a reconciliation to be received, neither she nor any other did ever doubt; for all did look for the seed of the woman, to make this reconciliation. He is the desire of all Nations, in the second chapter of
<hi>Aggai,</hi> and the eighth verse. The heathen did all equally worship this Redeemer, <hi>Acts</hi> the seventeenth, though ignorantly. But to take
<hi>Cain</hi> for <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Bar-Iesus</hi> for <hi>Jesus,</hi> is a great error.</p>
               <p>But, if she had not this conceite, yet she is to be blamed for the error of her hope, in that she calleth her first son <hi>Cain,</hi> a possession, as if he were the only Jewell, and the other <hi>Abell,</hi> that is Vanity, as if he were one to be despised, and of no reckoning. Wherein she shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that which is our common fault,
<note place="margin">We judge af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but God contrary.</note>for we alwayes judge after the outward appearance, whereas God rippeth the heart, and maketh most account of those things that seeme to be of least reckoning. This was <hi>Samuell's</hi> fault, when in choosing one to annoynt among the sons of <hi>Issa,</hi> did judge the tallest to be the party appointed by God: Whereas it was <hi>David</hi> the least, and of meanest reckoning among them, <hi>whome he had purposed to annoynte,</hi> in the first of <hi>Samuell</hi> and the sixteenth chapter. But this joy which she had of this son was <hi>vanum gaudium.</hi> It was a great error in her, that she accounteth him the greatest Jewell, that was of the seed of that evill one: and despiseth him that was the first Saint; who therefore is set down to be the first and cheifest of all the faithfull, in the eleventh chapter to the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> and the, second verse: Much more might she have called her first <hi>Abell,</hi> who became vanity and came to nought, who endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red sorrow for ever; And have called <hi>Abell</hi> a possession, for that he was the beginning of all Saints: Such a one as placed his felicity in the possession of the heavenly joyes.</p>

<note place="margin">2. In their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note>in the next, by their religion and profession in the service of God, both which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions have their ground, the second chapter and the seventh verse:
<note place="margin">Man consists of Body and Soul, to fill both Earth, and Heaven.</note>For where man is said to consist of two parts, body and soul; the one formed of the dust of the earth, the other breathed by God; that is, to shew that as according to Gods commandement, the first chapter of
<hi>Genesis</hi> and the twenty sixt verse: He hath a care to fill the earth, by bringing forth children: so he must be as carefull to fill heaven, by a second generation, that as he was to till the earth <hi>from whence his body was taken,</hi> chapter the third:
<note place="margin">Mans vocation maintain life and religion, a spirituall life.</note>So he must imploy his study in Gods service, from whence he received his soul, his care must be not only to leave behinde him a long generation, but <hi>semen sanctum, Mal.</hi> the second chapter, as they must have a voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby to maintain naturall life: So they must be religious and offer sacrifice, that leading a spirituall life here on earth, they may obtain eternall life in heaven.
<note place="margin">1. The naturall life, then the spirituall, and why?</note>But as <hi>Cain</hi> was first born after the flesh, and then
<hi>Abell:</hi> So alwaies flesh goeth before the spirit, nature before grace, as the Apostle witnesseth, the first of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> &amp; the fifteenth chapter, <hi>That is not first which is spirituall, but that which is naturall, and then that which is spirituall.</hi> Therefore God was first

                  <note place="margin">Children are not to be trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and why?</note>Before we come to their severall vocations, we have first to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider in generall, that <hi>Adam</hi> would not have either of his children trained up in idlenesse, and therefore he sets not only his younger sonne;
<note place="margin">But to labor in a vocation.</note>but even his heir to a trade and occupation: knowing that whereas God hath ordained, that man shall live by some painfull vocation, chapter the third, there is a thing, that both touched him and his, the necessity whereof is such as <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>Man is born to labor, even as a bird to flie,</hi> the fifth chapter of <hi>Job</hi> and the seventh verse: And as he imployeth in trade, as well the eldest as the youngest; So <hi>Abell</hi> the good, no lesse then
<hi>Gain</hi> the wicked sonne, for the godly have no liberty to live without some honest cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>Let a man abide in that calling wherein he is called,</hi> the first of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the seventh chapter and the twenty fourth verse: If the godly may not live idlely, much more ought wicked children to be set to some trade of life, The second point to be observed is, that there is no sooner men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the birth of these two brethren, but presently the Holy Ghost setteth down their trade, commending unto us from <hi>Adams</hi> example, that which
<hi>Salomon</hi> after teacheth, the twenty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter of the
<hi>Prov.</hi> Teach a childe in the beginning of his waies, and he will not depart from it when he is old,
<note place="margin">Seasonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in youth, and why?</note>for without seasonable instruction, children and youth are but vanity, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter of <hi>Eccle.</hi> and the third verse:
<note place="margin">All are not fit for one and the same calling, and why?</note>Both these sonnes are not set to one vocation, to shew that all men are not fit and meet, for one and the same calling; for as there is this diversity in the earth, out of which man is taken, that one part of it is sandy, some clay, and some gravell. And as in the heavenly light, there is that diversity which the Apostle speaks of, the first of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the fifteenth chapter and the fourty first verse, <hi>one star differing from another in glory:</hi> So the like variety appeareth in the dispositions of men, in so much as we see, all men are not meet for one thing. Fourthly, from hence we learn, that albeit the labors and trades of men be diverse:
<note place="margin">Callings must be such as God alloweth, and are serviceable to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and why?</note>yet they must be such as both God alloweth, and such as are serviceable to the publique wealth; we may not say because <hi>Cain,</hi> a reprobate, was a husbandman, that therefore God dislikes husbandary: for God affirmeth of <hi>Noah that he was a just and upright man,</hi> and yet he was an husbandman, <hi>Genesis</hi> the ninth chapter; nor that the office of keeping sheep, is therefore lawfull in Gods sight, because <hi>Abell</hi> the just was a sheephcard, for <hi>Juball</hi> the sonne of wicked <hi>Lamech was the father of them that dwelt</hi>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:62585:216"/>
                  <hi>in tents, and kept Sheep, Genesis</hi> the fourth chapter and the twentieth verse: and yet himself a wicked man, the person doth not make the calling lawfull, but it must be taken from God himself, and be such as God alloweth; touching husbandry Christ saith, <hi>My father is the Husbandman,</hi> the fifteenth chapter of <hi>John</hi> and the first verse,
<hi>and you are Gods husbandry,</hi> saith the Apostle, the first of the
<hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> the third chapter and the ninth verse: Therefore the calling of an husbandman is allowable; for the other calling, <hi>God himself is called the Shepheard of Israel,</hi> the eightieth <hi>Psalme</hi> and the first verse: and Christ saith of his Church, <hi>I have other sheep which I must gather under my government, that there may be but one shepheard, and one sheep-fold,</hi> the tenth chapter of <hi>John</hi> and the sixteenth verse:
<note place="margin">Husbandry and keeping sheep lawfull, and why?</note>By which titles we may collect, that both their callings are allowed of God, and for the profit, that they be serviceable; the wise man saith of them, <hi>the King is maintained by husbandry,</hi> the fifth chapter of
<hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> and the ninth verse: And for <hi>Abells</hi> trade, the seventh chapter of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> and the twenty sixth verse: <hi>The fleece of the lambs serve for thy cloathing, and the goats milk for thy food,</hi> So that both are profitable: And in regard of the great profit, that God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safeth to mankinde by both, all men doe testifie their thankfulnesse to God, for so great a benefit, not only at the bringing of harvest, in the ninth chapter of <hi>Esay</hi> and the third verse: but at their sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheering, in the first of <hi>Samuel</hi> the twenty fift chapter and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verse: And in the second of <hi>Samuell</hi> the thirteenth chapter and twenty third verse: by the example of <hi>Naball</hi> and <hi>Absalom,</hi> from whence we learn, not to set our selves to vain and unprofitable trades, but such as are both allowed of God, and serviceable to men. More particularly, if we ask what ground <hi>Adam</hi> had for this division, we shall finde, that there are two of great importance.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1. Reason. From Gods commission the ground of both trades.</note>The first, From Gods commission to <hi>Adam,</hi> in the first of <hi>Genesis</hi> and the twenty eighth verse, where he <hi>willeth him to till the earth,</hi> and <hi>to beare rule over all the beasts and Cattell on the earth.</hi> So that God will have men to doe two things, the one to follow husbandry, the other to keepe sheepe and other cattell: For Gods will is not that the earth shall be covered with nettles, like the slothfull mans vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, in the twenty fourth of the <hi>Proverbs;</hi> nor that the
<hi>cattell should wander about the mountaines, and be scattered without any shepheard to seeke after them,</hi> in the thirty fourth of <hi>Ezekiell:</hi> But will have the one painfully tilled and dressed, by the hand of the husbandman; and the other diligently and carefully looked unto, by the shepheard. This was <hi>Adams</hi> commission, and therefore he trained up his sons accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Reason.</note>Again, The earth it self taught <hi>Adam</hi> thus to dispose of his Children, which, as we know, divideth it self into arable and pasture ground, the one to bear Corn, the other to feed and rear up Cattell: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, as we see, <hi>Adam</hi> delivereth to <hi>Cain</hi> the charge of Tilling, that part which is arable, and to be plowed; and <hi>Abell</hi> is seized of the pasture grounds. The prioritie is given to husbandry, which is a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<pb n="372" facs="tcp:62585:217"/>of more excellency than the other, and therefore is committed to the elder son. For the earth being tilled and sowed by the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, bringeth forth bread to strengthen mans heart, in the hundred and fourth <hi>Psalm:</hi> and the necessity whereof is such, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be an unkinde part for <hi>Cain</hi> to kill <hi>Abell,</hi> that is, that no ground be left for pasture; yet it is a more unkind part for <hi>Abell</hi> to kill <hi>Cain,</hi> that is, that pasture should eat up arable ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The second ground.</note>And this ground taken from Gods commission, bringeth forth a second ground: For if there must be diverse works, as there must be where God appointeth diverse vocations, there are required diverse gifts, for the performance of those works;
<hi>Cain</hi> must have a gift meet for him that shall till the earth. And
<hi>Abell</hi> being a shepheard, must have that abilitie that is fit for that vocation.
<note place="margin">Severall gifts required in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and why?</note>In regard of which variety of works, the Apostle saith, <hi>Every one hath his proper gift af God, one after one manner, another after another,</hi> in the first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the seventh chapter, and the seventh verse, to teach us that severall gifts are to be imployed in severall vocations.
<note place="margin">We live either by care of minde, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of body: and why?</note>In the sentence uttered by God we have seen, that it is Gods will that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one shall live either by the care of his minde, or by the sweat of his body. For as members of our naturall bodies have their severall offices, in the twelfth chapter to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and the twelfth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the first <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> So (as all the members doe not labour, for some doe only take care, as the eye and the ear, other doe labor and sweat, as the hands and feet) in the body Politick there are divers members, and they accordingly have severall gifts from God. For as there is not only labour, but danger; so God hath qualified some men with gifts of minde, fit for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and avoiding of the one; and to others he hath given strength of body, to endure and sustain the other.
<note place="margin">Some callings require more the first than the latter: and why?</note>As there are some trades that require sweat and labour, and very little care; so there are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings that require great care and providence, and lesse labour; and therefore God distributeth severall gifts for the performance of them: To some he giveth more strength of body and great limbes; to others he giveth excellency of wit, to foresee and prevent danger:
<note place="margin">Gifts given to one, denyed to another: and why?</note>He giveth not to all men gifts alike but denyeth to one that which he giveth to others; <hi>That the eye should not say to the foot, I have no need of thee,</hi> in the twelfth chapter of the first <hi>Epistle</hi> to the
<hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> but that all might be ready to succour one another. The tilling of the ground requirethgreat paines and labour, and consisteth of great strength of body; but the office of a shepheard is not a matter of paines, so much as of foresight and providence: And therefore husbandmen that take great bodily paines; after their seed is sowen, have many holidayes, and a long time of rest; but the office of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sheepe and the care belonging to it never ceaseth, but lasteth day and night: Such was the care that <hi>Jacob</hi> had of <hi>Labans</hi> sheepe, in the thirty first chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and the fourtieth verse: Such care did the shepheards take every night, <hi>whome the Angells found watching all night,</hi> in the second chapter of
<hi>Luke:</hi> Therefore God <pb n="373" facs="tcp:62585:217"/>giveth <hi>Cain</hi> a more strong body; but <hi>Abell,</hi> as his calling required lesse bodily paines, so he was more weake of constitution, and was
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> with more sharpnesse of wit, than his Brother.</p>
               <p>Before we speak of the second calling, because this diversity requires a choice to be made, <hi>Abell</hi> must not be made a husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor <hi>Cain</hi> a shepheard.
<note place="margin">Children to be set to trades they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, and why?</note>That example, of <hi>Adams</hi> distribution in this point, should make us set our children to such trades as they are capable of:
<hi>David</hi> was not accustomed to bear <hi>Sauls heavie Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, but was fitter to use the sling,</hi> in the first of <hi>Samuell</hi> the seventeenth chapter and the thirtie ninth verse: Another confesseth himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be a Prophet, seeing he was alwaies an husbandman: therefore men must followthose trades of life, for which they are fit; The want of which discretion, is the confusion of Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
<note place="margin">Inconvenience of the contrary</note>There are saith <hi>Salomon, that have the price of wisedome in their hands, and have not wisdome in their hearts,</hi> in the sixteenth chapter of the
<hi>Proverbs:</hi> Such as have preferment in places, where they deserve it no; contrary-wise it is a great benefit to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, when men set their children to such trades as they are fit for.</p>

               <p>The oblation was a thing offered up whole as it was, without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration; But the Sacrifices were changed and consumed with fire.

<note place="margin">That they had offended God.</note>which told them, that seeing so many infirmities and sicknesses lay upon them, it was for that they had offended som body.
<note place="margin">2. That they owe thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for all they had, to be acknowledged, in heart, word and works.</note>Secondly, that all they possessed was from some superior power, to whom they ought to be both thankfull and dutifull, and to acknowledge both these in words, as well as in heart, and to expresse this subjection by works, that is, by offering somthing to God:
<note place="margin">2. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith, no reason or light of nature taught but by Gods spirit.</note>But as for confession of faith, no reason of man, no light of nature, that could apprehend that; but as Christ saith, in the sixteenth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> it was the Revelation of Gods Spirit, which taught them, that Christ the Lambe of<pb n="379" facs="tcp:62585:220"/>God should be offered as a Sacrifice for sinne; of which all the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices that went before were types.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abell</hi> we are to observe two points; First, what they had in common. Secondly, what severally.</p>

                  <note place="margin">All, both poor and rich must offer.</note>For the first, As we learn that all must offer, both in the Law, in the thirtieth chapter of <hi>Exodus;</hi> for God will have his offering, be we rich, or poor; and in the Gospell, where Christ alloweth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the poor widows oblation, <hi>Luke</hi> the twenty first: So both <hi>Cain</hi> and
<hi>Abel</hi> bring their offerings to God. The things they had in common are Three: First, Offerings. Secondly, To offer to God. Thirdly, They offer of their own, and that which they had gotten by their honest vocations.</p>

As God is the first and best thing; so he offered to God the first of his sheep, and the fattest among them: But <hi>Cain</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded this order: Of the difference of whose minds in offering, these verses are witnesses:
<hi>Abel,</hi> when he would offer, saith,
<q> Sacrum pingue dabo, nec macrum sacrificabo:</q> 
                  <hi>Cain</hi> saith,
<q>Sacrificabo macrum, nec dabo pingue sacrum.</q>
                  <hi>Cain</hi> was of the same minde, that the Priests were, that would be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before God had his part, in the first of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and sixteenth verse: So <hi>Cain</hi> will have enough for himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will once offer any thing to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when he doth offer he maketh no choyce of his obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but thinketh any thing good enough; but the Prophet saith,
<hi>Cursed be he that offereth a lame offering to God, and sacrificeth a corrupt thing; for I am a great King, Mal.</hi> the first chapter, and the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse: Offer such to thy Prince, would he be content to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept such offerings? but we will offer the best things to earthly Princes; how much more to the great King of Heaven; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wiseman saith, <hi>Honour God with thy substance, and that with the first fruits of thine increase, Proverbs</hi> the third and the ninth verse.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. Difference in the persons that offered</note>The third thing observed by the Apostle, is the person of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that offereth: <hi>Abel</hi> was a faithfull man, &amp; that made his sacrifice <hi>the better accepted, Heb.</hi> the eleventh and the fourth verse,
<hi>By faith</hi> Abell <hi>offered a better sacrifice than</hi> Cain: the faith of <hi>Abel</hi> was his assurance, that God was a great God, and would not accept of lame offerings; and therfore is carefull to bestow the best and first thing he had:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Abel's</hi> was to testifie his faith in Christ, and to expresse his thankfulness.</note>For knowing that sacrifices are testimonies of the thankfulness of the heart, <hi>Abel,</hi> to testifie his faith in the blood of Christ, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his thankfulness for the same, doth choose out of his flocks, the fattest of his sheep:
<note place="margin">Faith maketh men offer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and of the best things.</note>Faith maketh men offer often, and better things; but they that are without faith, care not how few times they offer, nor how small their oblations be.</p>

<hi>fides,</hi> where there is faith, there will be offerings; for, so saith the Apostle, that from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease<pb n="381" facs="tcp:62585:221"/>of faith, there was an increase of offerings in the Church: But when there is little faith or none at all, as in <hi>Cain</hi> there are offerings seldome made, and when they offer, it is the smallest and meanest things they have, the second to the

<hi>the offering is no more regarded nor received acceptably in his hands.</hi> On the other side the Lord beheld <hi>Cain</hi> and his offering, but he suffered not his eye to stay upon it, for hee did not allow of it;
<note place="margin">Testified by visible signs.</note>this acceptation the Fathers say was testified by a visible signe, and they ground this opinion upon the word, for the Apostle saith, the eleventh chapter to the
<hi>Hebrewes</hi> and the fourth verse, <hi>God bears Abel witnesse that hee was just,</hi> for it was usuall with God to testifie his liking of the service of his servants, by outward and visible testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, <hi>Leviticus</hi> the ninth chapter and the twenty fourth verse, <hi>there came fire from the Lord and wasted Aarons burnt offering,</hi> to shew that hee allowed it; so hee approved <hi>Gedeons</hi> Sacrifice, <hi>Judges</hi> the sixth chapter and the one and twentieth verse, when the Angell touching the flesh with the end of his staffe, <hi>caused fire to come forth and consume the flesh,</hi> whereby hee knew that his offering pleased God; So, <hi>when Salomon had ended his Prayer, fire came downe from heaven and consumed his Sacrifice and Oblation,</hi> the second of the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi> the seventh chapter and the first verse, but it is plain in the first of the <hi>Kings</hi> the eighteenth chapter and the twenty fourth verse.

               <p>But to come in particular to <hi>Abels</hi> Oblation, Gods liking is upon two things: upon the Person, and then upon the Gift; for <hi>non ex seipsis placent munera, sed ex offerentibus,</hi> and St. <hi>Augustine. non ex muneribus Abel, sed ex Abel muner a placuerunt,</hi> And St. <hi>Ambrose, priùs is qui dabat, quam ea quae

<note place="margin">Fret not at the prosperity of the wicked.</note>The Prophet affirmeth that he was offended at the prosperity of the wicked, in so much as he said, <hi>I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency, Psalm</hi> the thirty seventh, he could not tell what to think of it till he went to the

               <p>Thirdly, the example of <hi>Abels</hi> good service, and the favour which God vouchsafeth to him for the same, should have provoked

                  <hi>covered that shall not be known, nor hidden that shall not be revealed, Luke</hi> the twelfth chapter and the second verse.</p>
               <p>Touching the place where sinne lyeth, it is at the dore or gate; and this it maketh sinne to awake: For it cannot sleep by a dore, where there is continuall knocking. But there is a double interpretation of the word
<hi>dore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, it is referred to the dore of a mans conscience, of which it is said, <hi>Behold, I stand at the dore and knock,</hi> in the third chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and the twentieth verse. And according to this sense, Gods meaning is, that when sin is once committed, a mans consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will easily be disquieted with the least knocking, for the sleep of sinne is like the sleep of him that sleepeth <hi>upon the top of a mast,</hi> in the twenty third of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> and the thirty fourth verse, which being tossed to and fro of the winde, suffereth him not to take any quiet rest. And that sinne is wakned by the <hi>dore</hi> of the conscience, we have a plain example in the Children of <hi>Jacob;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Affliction knocketh at the dore of conscience, to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep.</note>for when affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction did knock at the
<hi>dore</hi> of their consciences, they remembred their sinne and confessed;
<hi>that all that misery was befallen them for their cruelty towards Joseph,</hi> in the fourty second of <hi>Genesis</hi> and the twenty second verse: and after <hi>Jacob</hi> was dead, the remorse of conscience did so waken them, that they would not be quiet till they had asked <hi>Joseph</hi> forgivness for their cruelty towards him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because there are some that can sear up their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, so as they will not be touched with any remorse: Therefore there is another <hi>dore</hi> whereat sinne is said to lye, that is <hi>the dore or gate of death, Psalm</hi> the ninth, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the thirty eighth and the tenth verse, <hi>I am going to the gate of death.</hi> This gate or dore cannot be shut up; we cannot escape death, <hi>&amp; Judex stat prae foribus, Jeremiah</hi> the fifth chapter; as soon as we are out of the dore of death, we shall see the Judge ready to give sentence upon us, and to condemn us for our sinnes:
<note place="margin">Sinne barketh like a dogge.</note>then sinne shall not bark like a Dog, but howle and roar as a Lyon, not suffering us to take any rest, but keep us in continuall torment: The consideration of so great miserie as is procured by sinne, should terrific us from sinne, unless we be worse than beasts, who by no means will be brought to run into the fire or any other apparent danger, use what extremity towards them you will.</p>

                  </gap> diversly translated, yet are all true and of due and high regard, and have very fruitfull and godly meditations; for there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that refer this word <hi>ejus</hi> to <hi>Abell,</hi> that is, thy brothers desire shall be to thee, which is not here meant. There are others that refer it thus because no mention is made here of <hi>Abell,</hi> but that sinne is the last thing spoken of, therefore they refer it to sinne thus; the desire of it shall be to thee, which is the best translation, and the most fit and congruent sense, agreeing with the words. So then to deal truly and uprightly, I have told you that the words may bear both sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses well and with good profit, therefore I will take them both first together, and then tell you which is best: If then we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it to be <hi>Abel,</hi> which cannot be referred to any mans person so well as to <hi>Abels,</hi> take it so, as if God should say, indeed I respect thy brother, and if thou rejoycest that <hi>Abel</hi> is respected, thou dost well, for so thou shouldst doe; but thou art grieved thereat: Why then art thou so sad? Here God expostulates with him, &amp; it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of his action, because it is a foolish thing to doe that which hath no good reason to be rendred, to warrant the doing of it; Therefore God divideth the sense into two parts; either the reason must be in God or in
<hi>Abel,</hi> in God for favouring him, or in <hi>Abel,</hi> because favoured of God. Now God in the former part hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himself, saying, <hi>If thou dost well, shalt not thou be accepted?</hi> for behold I am just, and will regard thy well doing, therefore thou hast no cause to be grieved for that: Or else thou shalt be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to justice, and that in bounty and liberality, which is by ancient Fathers grounded upon the words of God to

                  <hi>would not the death of sinner,</hi> and therefore giveth him time to repent: This sheweth that God gave him no cause of grief. There remains that the grief must be conceived against <hi>Abel,</hi> because God so much respected him; but so the sense is, as if God should say,
<hi>Cain</hi> art thou grieved for <hi>Abels</hi> good, and fearest he should grow insolent by the favour I have shewed him, and so he should despise, and thou shouldst be vile in his eyes? If <hi>Abel</hi> have offended thee, why his desire shall be subject to thee, but that is no cause why thou shouldst be grieved; for he being the Child of grace, doth not affect any such manner of superiority as thou fearest, but is as modest and as hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as he was before, and so thou hast no reason of impatiencie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
               <p>And not only that first, but this second, that God shewed plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it is his will that in and by the sin committed no man should lose any priviledge which of right is due to him, and which before hee had; and every motion, in a Superior, to sinne doth not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him of his authority. Which is contrary to that false opinion and censure of them which thinke that even Princes themselves, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sinne committed, lose all their prerogative and supremacy of government which they had before, and that their Subjects are not bound to doe their service any longer to them, but that ever after their allegiance shall cease, which is false and contrary to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and not Gods intent and will here. For as in the chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after <hi>Adam</hi> had sinned, yet <hi>Eve</hi> was still subject to him; so the same God saith, and ratifieth here, that <hi>Cain</hi> though he had thus sinned both against God and his brother, yet being the elder and first born, and so before
<hi>Abel,</hi> so there should be a superiority and dominion that he should still retain by nature: And it is Gods assertion, that that superiority should be reteined still, and that <hi>Abel</hi> should not seek to be his Superior; neither did he. That was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative which <hi>Cain</hi> had before
<hi>Abel,</hi> as the elder. But to yeeld this obedience, hath been the continuall practise of all the Saints and Children of God: King <hi>Saul</hi> was a wicked man, yet <hi>David</hi> rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not against him, because he knew him to be the Lords annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; so the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> saith of
<hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> a wicked King, that he will visite the Nation and Kingdome that will not serve him, the twenty seventh chapter of
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> and the ninth verse; and for the new Testament, both
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> confess the same; <hi>Paul</hi> in the first to <hi>Timothy,</hi> the second chapter and the second verse, and
<hi>Peter,</hi> in the first epistle of <hi>Peter,</hi> the second chapter and the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse, doe will, <hi>that duty and allegiance be given to the higher powers,</hi> not only if they be good, but though they be Tyrants and wicked Princes that fear not God: And it is it that God saith by <hi>Job, Job</hi> the thirty fourth chapter and the thirtieth verse, <hi>that by him the Hypocrite reigneth,</hi> that is, for their sinnes God will send wicked Princes, and <hi>Cain</hi> shall bear rule over <hi>Abel:</hi> God doth not only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that thus it was, but thus he would have it. This Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus by God established, in the beginning was by <hi>David, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi>

                  <hi>Paul, Peter, Job,</hi> and all the rest of the Patriarchs and Saints of God confessed and allowed: So that if we regard

<hi>Cain,</hi> or we respect Gods goodness herein, no just cause can be of grief, neither was it Gods will that <hi>Abel</hi> should resist, neither doth he any such thing; and so indeed there was no just cause why <hi>Cain</hi> should fear it or be grieved: And this may suffice for the first, which I will shut up with this Caveat of instruction

<hi>Cain</hi> himself, whom God repeats four times together in the words of this Text (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) and so he must return to his own heart, and remember how his own sinne is cause of his grief, as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self speaketh by <hi>Isaiah</hi> the fourty sixth chapter and the eighth verse,
<hi>Remember thus and be ashamed, bring it again to minde you transgressors:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note>And for the new Testament,
<hi>Luke</hi> the fifteenth chapter, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall Sonne when he came to himself, confessed his own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness, and said, <hi>Father I have sinned;</hi> which is another main point of Divinity established from the beginning, that as God saith, <hi>Hosea</hi> the fifteenth and the ninth
<hi>perditio tua ex te Israel, salus autem ex me,</hi> so our well doing or ill doing is cause of our regarding or destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; so saith <hi>James, no man is tempted of God, for God cannot be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ill, neither doth he tempt any man, but every one is tempted of his own concupiscence, James</hi> the first chapter and the thirteenth verse: So that from the first we have this Doctrine, that if God be judged he is innocent, and if <hi>Abel,</hi> there is no fault in him, and to come to <hi>Cain,</hi> he is in all the fault.</p>
               <p>But now if we come about and say, it is not meant of the person, but of the things, that is sinne; then we must proceed another way, yet true and very profitable; and so say <hi>ad te appetitus ejus; ejus</hi> saith
<hi>Augustine, cujus? numquid fratris absit.</hi> Nay saith he, it is
<hi>appetitus peccati;</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> doth ground this upon
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> the fifteenth chapter and the ninteenth verse, where it is said, <hi>If thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;</hi> and in the same verse <hi>ipsi convertantur ad te non tu ad illos:</hi> and so after <hi>Austin, St. Jerome</hi> saith excellently, <hi>ne peccatum illi, sed ille peccato dominaretur,</hi> not that sinne might have dominion over him, but he over sinne; and so in a manner dealt all the ancient Divines. It is well known <hi>St. Jerome</hi> knew the tongues, and was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Scriptures, and so the sense is more perfect and compleat this way than the other. This then is the point of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as before by way of praise and threat; so here God deals by way of admonition, which is brought in by way of supposing an excuse, as if one should say, I would not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Here are two things propounded: First, our own state in these words, <hi>but unto thee his desire shall be subject:</hi> Secondly, our duty what to doe, <hi>thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> rule over him.</hi> For the first, I grant it, thou canst not live without it,
<hi>for sinne lyeth at the dore,</hi> knocking, and will run in and embrace thee if thou open the dore to it; it is not possible, but <hi>ad te appetitus ejus,</hi> sinne will be taking hold of thee, as it is exactly set down,
<hi>Hebrews</hi> the twelfth chapter; sinne hangs on fast. This is your state saith God, and take notice of it, but then doe your duty; when sinne knocks, look that you shut the dore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it; when sinne runs to you, see you turn your back on it, and when it desires, let it be in vain; and then saith <hi>St. Austen, &amp; surgendo &amp; proferendo frustra defatigetur, ut tandem mihi proferat, &amp; discat amplius non surgere;</hi> and this it is that God would have us to remember, to repell sinne by striving against it, and not become Slaves to it by serving the lusts of it; For as many times as a man refuseth the conversion and turning of the oportunities of sinne, it is the redoubling of so many rewards and crowns in the Kingdome of heaven: so that I tell you (as often I have) that it signifies both comfort and exhortation, that that which exhorts should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and that which comforts should exhort too.</p>
               <p>First for comfort; not that any man should think himself forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and out of the compass of Gods favour, when sinne runs to him; for therefore it is called conversion, it is the motion that water hath in hollow places, that howsoever on hills or steep places it runs down, yet in hollow places it staieth,; such is the nature of sinne: As if God should say, seeing your nature is such, that it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined to sinne, by the teint and corruption of the poyson of that Serpent which first beguiled your first Parents, which every man in his own nature hath sense of, yet he feels no more than all the dear Saints of God have felt. Therefore that it should not seem strange to any man when he seeth sinne run to him, and findes those temptations of sin and motions thereunto; for it is no other thing than what is incident to all, the first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the tenth chapter and the thirteenth verse, <hi>No temptation hath taken you, but such as is incident to man.</hi> Now that is our inclination naturall, which we cannot avoid here in this life, and that is comfort against the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of sinne, that our case is no worse than other mens. But withall to this comfort God joyns exhortation, that for as much as we shall be continually provoked and assaulted by sinne, and sin will run to us and ly at the dore, yet we are not to goe and meet it, and if not goe meet it, we must take heed <hi>we draw it not to us with cart-ropes,</hi> as if it came not fast enough, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the fist chapter and the eighteenth verse; and as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> speaks, <hi>we may not be as dragons sucking still, Ezekiel</hi> the fourth chapter and the second verse, <hi>nor put the stumbling blocks of iniquity before our face, Ezekiel</hi> the fourth chapter; <hi>we may not plough for sinne, Proverbs</hi> the twenty first chapter<pb n="403" facs="tcp:62585:232"/>and the fourth verse, as if he should say, sinne will come fast e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the fallow grounds; therefore we need not to provoke our selves by pictures, lewd songs, enterludes, and such like means <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>to cut off all occasions to sinne,</hi> observing what that is that provoketh them to sinne, and cut that off that we draw not sinne to our selves, and so be accessary to sinne, and cause of our own woe: If the water be comming, that we give no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to it; if the coals lye before you, spit on it you may, but beware you blow it not; and if sinne would have passage, stop it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Here are four divisions or distinctions.</p>
               <p>First, God saith, There is sinne in body, and sinne in soul; there are as well corporall sinnes as mentall, and as well actuall as cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p>

                     </gap> a sinne against man as well as God.</note>Secondly, <hi>Si bene feceris, nonne acceptaberis?</hi> so that God saith plainly, he that beareth malice doth not well, that is, he sinneth against his brother, for a man may as well sinne against man as against God, for that Gods command is, <hi>Love thy Brother or Neighbour as thy self;</hi> therefore a man should not imagine, that except he offendeth God, he sinneth not. That is a second distinction.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sinne sleeping and waking.</note>A third distinction is, <hi>peccatum cubans</hi> and <hi>vigilans,</hi> that is sinne sleeping and lying still, and sinne waking, that is the temptation of sinne before and while it is committed, and then the remorse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The fourth and last distinction, is that which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> a difference between the Children of God and of the Devill, between the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and the regenerate; that in the godly there is <hi>peccatum

                  </hi> but not
<hi>dominans,</hi> sin ruleth but reigneth not; from hence is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that which the Prophet saith, in the nineteenth <hi>Psalm, Keep thy servant from presumptuous sinnes;</hi> and in the one hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth <hi>Psalm, Direct my steps, that no iniquitie have dominion over me;</hi> so the Apostle in the sixth chapter to the <hi>Romans, Let not sinne reigne in your mortall bodies;</hi> yet he confesseth, in the seventh chapter to the <hi>Romans, that sinne dwelleth in him:</hi> By which we may see plainly what it meaneth; for sinne would command a mans body, his eye, foot and hand, yea, set all the parts of his body a work, about that it

                  </gap>: But that party when sinne biddeth him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:62585:233"/>still; when sinne biddeth him stretch out his hand, can clasp it close; when sinne biddeth him delight his eye, can shut it close; when sinne biddeth take to heart, and one doth with sighs shake it off; he that when sin commeth running, shutteth the dore against it, &amp; avoideth all provocations; in such a one, there is <hi>peccatum currens</hi> but not <hi>dominans.</hi> That is for the division, and the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two sorts of persons.</p>
               <p>But secondly, we have a main foundation, which the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Doctors ground upon the thirteene verses of the third chapter, where God useth the same words to the woman, that he useth to <hi>Cain</hi> here, <hi>Why hast thou done this?</hi> And the Woman said, <hi>The Serpent beguiled me;</hi> It sheweth that the proceding of <hi>Cains</hi> sinne, was as the first sinne was; for the Serpent first shewed her the fruit, <hi>and she did eat;</hi> and then after, she shewed it to <hi>Adam,</hi> and it pleasing his sight, <hi>he likewise did eat.</hi> This is the proceeding of sinne, from the Serpent to <hi>Eve,</hi> from her to <hi>Adam,</hi> and so here the presuming of reason in <hi>Cain,</hi> contrary to reason, was as that in
<hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam;</hi> and therefore, as after God said to the woman,
<hi>Thy desire shall be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to thy husbands, and he shall rule over thee;</hi> so here he saith, <hi>Cain</hi> shall bear rule over sin, and the same shall befall in mans sensuality, that is, his lusts and concupiscence, which befell his uper part, which is his reason, alluring him and drawing him to sinne: Therefore they call the understanding and reason, which is the uper part of the soul, <hi>Adam;</hi> and the lower part, that is the affection,
<hi>Eve.</hi> The desire and pleasure of sinne, that is the apple, and sinne is as the Serpent. As this is grounded upon the speech of God; so is it upon the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and manner of sinne; whereby man is caught as a fish with the bait, in the first chapter of <hi>James;</hi> for reason taketh the bait first: Such a proceeding is in all sinne, and there is no other tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to sinne now then there was in the beginning to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> Thus much for our state and duty arising by way of instruction and exhortation, to behave our selves so, as <hi>sinne get not the rule over us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the last in these words, <hi>But thou shalt bear rule over it:</hi> Wherein we ask, How shall this be fulfilled? can we give to nature that power and freewill? nay, it is plain, we cannot, neither is Gods intent so to doe, for <hi>we are not able of our selves, as from our selves, to think a good thought,</hi> as it is in the second to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the third chapter, and the third verse; for <hi>we have all been as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing, all our righteousnesse is like a filthy cloth,</hi> in the sixty fourth chapter of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and the sixth verse: so that he that hath no more in him than the strength of nature, <hi>is as he that followeth the steps of an harlot,</hi> whose case is like to the <hi>oxe that goeth to the slaughter,</hi> as it is in the seventh chapter of the <hi>Proverbs.</hi> Therefore it is not to be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, neither is it in our strength to doe it, for where God saith, <hi>Tee shall rule over it;</hi> Is our strength able to doe thus? No. Further as <hi>Moses</hi> said, in the 30. of
<hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> and the 14. that Gods meaning in giving him the Law, was not that he could doe it, or should of himself, but it was <hi>verbum fidei;</hi> the word was as near to<pb n="405" facs="tcp:62585:233"/>thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart to doe it. This word is the word of promise, as
<hi>Paul</hi> expoundeth it, in the tenth chapter to the <hi>Romans:</hi> The means to rule sinne is as near thee as sinne is. <hi>Say not in thy heart, who shall goe up into heaven?</hi> the means is <hi>the word of faith,</hi> which assureth thee of Christ <hi>the promised seed,</hi> who shall for thee
<hi>break the head of the Serpent,</hi> as it is in the third chapter of
<hi>Genesis,</hi> and <hi>give thee the victorie over sinne;</hi> for else this doctrine had been false, if that promise had not gone before; then there is Christ, <hi>without whom we can doe nothing but sinne,</hi> as himself speaketh, <hi>Sine me nihil potestis facere,</hi> in the fifteenth chapter of
<hi>John</hi> &amp; the fifth verse; It is he that giveth repentance, in the second <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>Gregory,</hi> who saith, <hi>Justus Deus instat prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepto, quia cùm instat ptaecepto, praecurrit auxilio;</hi> so that if a man can remember what Christ hath done, how that he which hath broken the Serpents head, will give us power to bear rule over sinne; as he is able, so will he, if we be earnest suitors to him for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, give us grace and strength whereby to resist temptations of sinne. So saith the Apostle, in the second to the <hi>Carinthians,</hi> the sixt chapter, and the first verse, <hi>If wee receive not this grace in vain,</hi> or if we be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it, by falling away from the grace of God, in the twelfth chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and the fifteenth verse, then shall we be able to have dominion over sinne. As this is true, and cannot be denyed, that God hath shut up all under sinne, to have mercie over all; so <hi>he will pour out his spirit upon all flesh,</hi> in the second of <hi>Joel,</hi> and the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eighth verse. What spirit? <hi>The spirit of grace and prayer,</hi> in the twelfth chapter of <hi>Zechariah;</hi> that is, <hi>Psalm</hi> the

Albeit, it is certain we shall not need to run to Christ, for he saith, <hi>Revelations</hi> the third chapter, verse the twentieth, <hi>Ecce, sto ad ostium &amp; pulso,</hi> it is but to open the dore, and let him in. When sinne lyeth at the dore, Christ lyeth there too, so that it is but to open to him when he knocketh, and sinne will away: For let <hi>Gideon arise, and his enemies will fly:</hi> So will sinne fly if Christ come; and we shall come safe out of our dores, if we let Christ in.</p>
               <p>To conclude: Then seeing we see our estate by nature, and what Gods will is, who hath left us a means whereby we may <hi>bear rule over sinne;</hi> we must take notice of it, that is, run to the promised seed of the woman. It is needfull that we know the sense of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that is, that we have a sense of those contrary sollicitations to sinne, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith,
<hi>I delight in the Law of God, touching the inward man, but I have another Law,</hi> in the seventh to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the twenty second verse;
<hi>There is a continuall combat and strife between the flesh and spirit, the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh,</hi> the fifth chapter to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and the seventeenth verse. When we cannot tell what sinne is, nor what be the effects and fruits of it, and how it solliciteth and desireth, &amp; when it reigns we are ready to meet it, and runne as fast to sinne as sinne cometh to us; and that is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: Therefore we must take notice of his conflict, and know, that between the heel and the head, this conflict shall for ever be, <hi>Genesis,</hi> the third chapter and the fifteenth verse; and every man shall have either <hi>peccatum habitans, vel occurrens;</hi> but which shall have dominion, whether flesh or spirit, nature or grace, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently said by <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the sixteenth chapter of the <hi>Proverhs, He that ruleth his own minde and lusts, hath a greater victorie than he that winneth a City;</hi> for they that winne Cities, are oftentimes slaves to their own lusts, and a small appetite overcometh them; This is not the conquest here spoken of but the masterie over our sensualitie, is it that God meaneth, and he that overcommeth it shall receive a crown at Gods hand, as the Apostle saith, <hi>I have fought a good fight hence forth is layed up for me a crown,</hi> in the second epistle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> and the fourth chapter. Now every man is not in case to goe into the field, to encounter with his enemie, and to winne Cities; but every Christian is in state to strive against his own lusts, and to fight with sinne, which is the Serpents seed: There must be a bruising between the heel of <hi>Adams</hi> seed, and the Serpents head; this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat we must all undergoe: whereof we have matter of comfort, if wee overcome in this conflict; and also of instruction and admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that seeing God mislikes sinne, promising reward to them that
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:62585:234"/>doe well, and threatning them that doe evill, saying, that <hi>sinne lyeth at the dore;</hi> that as one day shall come, when this condition shall be as between the Creditor and Debtor, between the Judge and malefactor: But withall he sheweth, that howsoever our nature be inclined to sinne, yet as Gods conclusion to <hi>Cain</hi> is, that sinne shall not get dominion over him, but he shall rule over it by grace offered to him; so if we by prayer be earnest Suitors to God for grace, and take hold of it being offered, we shall be conquerors over sinne in Christ and bear rule, and in the end we shall obtein the reward promised, which is eternall happiness in the Kingdome of heaven.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by shewing him not only that he should by finne deprive himself of God, but procure his own woe, and be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it. And lastly, by ministring to him comfort, that from the blessed seed of the woman, that hath broken the head of the Serpent, he should receive strength to subdue sinne; yet for all this <hi>he stops his eare lyke the deaf Adder, Psalm</hi> the fifty eighth, and saith with them, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the fourty fourth and the sixteenth verse, <hi>Say what you will, we will doe what pleaseth our selves.</hi> This was <hi>Cains</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and this was theirs also that heard <hi>Jeremy: Ezekiel</hi> the thirty third chapter and thirty first verse, <hi>They come and fit before thee; they hear thy words, but doe them not; but their heart goeth on their covetonsness, and runneth upon their worldly affaires.

But we are further to note, that
<hi>Cain</hi> was not only not a whit better, but far worse after the Sermon; he went as the Psalmist speaks, <hi>Psalm</hi> the sixty ninth, <hi>from one wickedness to another;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note>he proceeded from wrath to deadly hatred, and from hatred to murther, from <hi>peccatum in affectu</hi> to
<hi>peccatum in effectu, for the word that goeth out of Gods mouth, shall not return to him void, but shall accomplish that which God will, and prosper in the things whereto he sent it:</hi>

                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>It is like the rain that falleth down from heaven and watereth the earth, which though it bring not forth good corn, yet it causeth thorns and thistles to spring up, Isaiah</hi> the fifty fifth chapter and the tenth and eleventh varies: and so the Apostle saith, that the Gospel preached by him is not in vain, but is either <hi>odor vitae ad vitam,</hi> or <hi>odor mortis ad mortem,</hi> the second to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the second chapter; and this effect it hath, not that it is the nature of Gods word to bring forth evill,
<note place="margin">Example.</note>but as the nature of water is to coals, and never to kindle unless it be in lime, which is hot and kindled by means which naturally cooleth and quencheth all other things; so where the nature of Gods word is to kill sinne, if it be uttered to the wicked which perish, sinne is made unreasonably sinfull by the word, <hi>Romans</hi> the seventh chapter; and wicked men are the more hardened in their sinne, when by the word they are reproved of sinne: Hence it is, that men being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and checked of sinne by the word, have proved more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
<note place="margin">Note. The worse by reprehension.</note>As
<hi>Abner</hi> being reproved by <hi>Isbosheth,</hi> was the worse, in the second of <hi>Samuel</hi> and the third chapter, so <hi>Asa</hi> being reproved of the Prophet was the worse, in the second of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> and the fifteenth chapter.</p>
               <p>For the pariculars of this verse, we must know, that
<hi>Cain's</hi> sinne is not a sinne presently committed, but that kinde of sinne, which is plowed for: He goeth about and fetcheth a compass, before he committeth the deed: He had already resolved to murther his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if opportunity would serve, before he spake word to him: And as <hi>he that looketh after a woman, to lust after her, hath already committed adulterie in his heart,</hi> in the fifth chapter of <hi>Matthew;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Murther in heart, not acted.</note>so
<hi>Cain</hi> was already guilty of murther, though it were not actually commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and so it was with <hi>Judas,</hi> so soon as he had agreed with the Scribes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to kill Christ, he was guilty of murther before God, as if it were already done: All the while that he was compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting with them about his death, he was in that sinne as Christ saith of him, <hi>Quod facis fac cito, John</hi> the thireenth chapter, and the twenty seventh verse; only <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> wanted but opportunity, which so soon as they had obtained, they committed their sinne actually.</p>
               <p>The causes of <hi>Cains</hi> proceeding to the committing of this act, are diverse down after diverse sorts.</p>
               <p>First, he seeketh a convenient place and opportunity, and maketh choyce of the field, because he would not be hindred in doing the murther; for he could not have any opportunitie at home; for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> being at hand, would have been ready to hinder him. <pb n="410" facs="tcp:62585:236"/>And as he makes choyce of this place, not to be hindered; so, in that after he denyed the fact, it appeareth, his desire was as well not to be discovered, as not to be hindred. Wherein we have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect first his great blindness, that could not see the nature of sinne; for in that he sought such a place for the doing of it, as might be hid and unknown: It is strange he could not perceive it to be a work of darkness; his own conscience did condemn him, for he durst not be seen to doe that which he did, but in hypocrisie would seem not to be what he was; this was his way, and we must beware that we walk not in it. Again, it is strange that he was more afraid of <hi>Adam</hi> a mortall man, than of the omnipotent God, and was more fearfull, that <hi>Adam</hi> his Father, a mortall man, should see him, than that God who is able to grinde him in a morter, should behold his fact. Wherefore as sinne is a dishonest thing, perswading against all reason, to fear man more than God, so is it a dishonest thing; for that we will not be seen to commit sinne, as a thing that standeth not with their credits, and therefore make choice of such places as are fittest for the concealing thereof.</p>

<hi>Abel</hi> to that place, and what means to use, that <hi>Abel</hi> might goe confidently with him thither: To that end, though he have not now spoken to him of a long time, yet he is content to speak kindly to him. The heathen man saith, that if a man will hate, he must doe it <hi>apertè,</hi> unless he will be worse thin wilde beasts, for they violenly flie upon those things which they hate;

                  <hi>Cain</hi> to dissemble his hatred with fair words, which dissimulation is a sinne, condemned not only of the heathen, but abhorred by the Saints of God: For when such a one as walks in the house of God with him as his friend and companion, should deceive him, then
<hi>David</hi> had cause to pray against such a one, <hi>Psalm</hi> the fifty fifth; <hi>Let death seize upon him. Cain</hi> though he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his brother and purposed his death, yet to accomplish his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purpose, he makes a fair semblance of love:
<note place="margin">Example.</note>So <hi>Absolom</hi> being minded to murther <hi>Ammon,</hi> pretends great love to him; he must needs have <hi>Ammon</hi> to the Sheep-shearing, or else all his cost is lost;

                  </note>Touching the death of
<hi>Abel,</hi> we are to observe from the words, First it was a violent death, for his life did not goe out of him, but as the word signifieth, it was rent from him. Secondly, it was a bloody death, as the words of God to <hi>Cain</hi> shew; <hi>The voice of thy Brothers blood which thou hast slain cryeth to me,</hi> verse the tenth. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was a sudden death, and therefore more grievous, because thereby not only the body is killed but the soul also, of such a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is in state of sinne, and hath not respite graunted to repent thereof.</p>
               <p>In this act of <hi>Cain,</hi> we have to observe these things wherby his sin is aggravated: First, the sinne which he committeth is murther, a sinne the more grievous, for that it is the defacing of Gods Image,
<hi>Genesis</hi> the ninth chapter. Secondly, his fact the more odious, for that the party murthered is one more weak than himself, for he was younger than
<hi>Cain,</hi> therefore it was a cowardly part to set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his inferiour: It is the thing which the Wise-man complaineth, <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> the eighth chapter, <hi>I saw one man bear rule over another,</hi> not for good: so the authority and superiorty which was committed to <hi>Cain,</hi> should have been for <hi>Abels</hi> good, but he abused it to the hurt of his younger brother. Thirdly, where God will not have any innocent blood shed, but sacrifice must be offered, <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> the twenty first chapter, <hi>Cain</hi> kills innocent <hi>Abel,</hi> which doth in a third degree aggravate his sinne; for to shed innocent blood is a thing that <hi>Pilate</hi> himself could not abide,
<hi>and therefore washed his hands, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was clear from killing Christ, Matthew</hi> the twenty seventh chapter and the twenty fourth verse. Fourthly, he breaks the bond of nature, for the party murthered is his brother, and so he becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Romans</hi> the first chapter. Fiftly, he feares not to kill him though he know it will be to the great grief of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:62585:237"/>his Parents, wherein he deals worle than <hi>Esau,</hi> who would not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his hatred against <hi>Jacob till the dayes of mourning for his Father were past, Genesis</hi> the twenty seventh chapter. Sixtly, it was not done <hi>ex irae impetu,</hi> but <hi>ex odii habitu;</hi> and against such the Prophet prayeth, <hi>be not mercifull to such as sinne of malicious wickedness, psalm</hi> the fifty ninth. Seventhly, his hatred was not open,
<note place="margin">Cloaked ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note>but cloaked and hidden under a shew of love, which makes it more grievous. <hi>It was not mine enemie that did me this dishonour, for then I could have born it: It was not mine adversary, that exalted himself against me, for I would have hid my self; but it was thou my companion, my guid and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friend, therefore let death seiz upon him, Psalm</hi> the fifty fifth and the twelfth, thirteenth and fifteenth verses. Eighthly, this sinne is committed after Gods admonition, who had uied all means to draw him to repentance. Ninthly, not only being admonished, but seeing his Father made an example of Gods wrath, whom he saw daily labouring and moyling in the earth for his disobedience to God. Tenthly, that which makes <hi>Cains</hi> sinne out of reason sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>Romans</hi> the seventh, is the cause, not for any offence that <hi>Abel</hi> had committed, but for doing his duty in Gods service, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle noteth in the first epistle of <hi>John,</hi> the third chapter and the twelfth verse, <hi>Wherefore slew he him? because his own works were evil and his brothers good.</hi>

                     </gap> is the means by which death entred into the world, Romans</hi> the fift chapter; and yet that <hi>Abel</hi> a righteous man, is the first that drank of this Cup, in the old Testament, as <hi>John Baptist</hi> was in the new, it will make him say, <hi>Hoc est onus Jehovae,</hi> as it is in the twenty third chapter of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and the thirty fourth verse; and
<hi>hic est durus sermo, John</hi> the sixt chapter: The Apostle saith,
<hi>Godlinesse hath promises both in this life and the life to come,</hi> in the first epistle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> the fourth chapter and the eighth verse; and among the promises of this life <hi>long life is one,</hi> in the sixt chapter to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and the third verse, which God
<hi>promiseth to them that honour their Superiors.</hi> On the other side God threatneth, that <hi>the blood thirsty and deceitfull man shall not live out half his dayes, Psalm</hi> the fifty fift: And yet <hi>Cain</hi> lived long, and <hi>Abel</hi> a godly man dyed soon. Therefore, when we see the righteous dye quickly, and the wicked live long, we must take heed we stumble not at Gods doings, but justifie God, and acknowledge that <hi>he is just and true, and every man a lyar, Psalm</hi> the fifty first, <hi>Romans</hi> the third chapter. Therefore to make this point plain, it is true, long life is promised as a blessing of God; which he promiseth to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers of his command; but withall we must know, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain causes, wherein this rule holdeth not true, that the dutifull and holy man shall live long in this world.</p>
               <p>The exceptions are:</p>
               <p>First, in respect of the parties themselves, to whom this blessing is promised: It is with a Godly man, as with the fruit of trees, if after it is once ripe, it besuffered to continue on the trees, it will be rotten; so it is with good men in this world: And therefore the Wiseman saith of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that because <hi>he lived amongst sinners, God translated him, and he took him away, least wickednesse should alter his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and deceit beguile his minde, Sapi.</hi> the fourth chapter. In such a case it is not a benefit, but a detriment for a man to live long: And there is no man, but in such a respect, will be content, that God shall break promise with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another exception is in respect of the punishment of sinne: If a party that pleaseth God, should by living long become miserable, he would not think long life a blessing; and therefore God in mercy took away good
<hi>Josiah</hi> that he should not see the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series that were to come upon the Jews, by the captivitie, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and the thirty fourth chapter; this favour he vouchsafed to that godly King, because his heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> at the hearing of the booke of the Lawe, and did not harden his heart as <hi>Cain.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:62585:238"/>Thirdly, in respect of God; of whom
<hi>August.</hi> saith, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth on some men the blessing of long life, because he will be known to be the Author of it: But lest we should think there is no other life but this, therefore he taketh the blessing of long life from some of his servants, to shew that there is another life, wherein they shall be partakers of the promises; for if God doe not reward the godly in this life, doubtlesse it standeth with his justice to reward them in the world to come.
<hi>God will try the patience of his servants, and the obedience of them that keep his commandements, Apoc.</hi> the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter, and the twelfth verse; he will have it appear, that we are not mercenaries and hirelings, that serve him for temporall benefits. The Children of God are not such as Satan thought <hi>Job</hi> to be, that is, <hi>one that would not serve God for nought;</hi> and God to shew that <hi>Job</hi> served him, without any such respect of present reward, took away all that he had, and so made the patence of that holy man appear. So <hi>Abel</hi> served not God for a temporall reward; he was as willing to sacrifice himself, as the lambe which he offered; so is it with all godly Saints. The Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> cared not for his life, <hi>so he might finish his course with joy, Acts</hi> the twentieth chapter;
<note place="margin">Note. Gods favour better than life.</note>
                  <hi>They esteeme more of Gods favour than of life, Psalm</hi> the sixty third. And therefore <hi>Abel</hi> said with himself, I will rather forgoe my life, than not offer to God such a sacrifice as should please him: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we see Gods end in depriving of the godly of outward blessings, that it is to try their patience; and though they dye, yet <hi>death is to them no losse, but advantage,</hi> as it is in the first chapter to the
<hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> For if <hi>Abel</hi> for long life on earth, have eternall life in heaven, he hath no wrong done him; if for a life of vanity, as
<hi>Abel's</hi> was, God give him a life of verity, he hath no injury offered him: But God performeth his promise of long life, much better than if he suffered them to continue long in the flesh; for no man liveth so long but his life shall have an end; <hi>&amp; nihil est longum, quod finem habet:</hi> If in stead of vanity and sorrow, he have happinesse and glorie, he hath no cause to complain. Besides, the Righteous though they dye never so soon, yet <hi>they shall be had in everlasting remembrance,</hi> as it is in the one hundred &amp; twelfth <hi>Psalm;</hi> And <hi>the memoriall of the just is blessed,</hi> in the tenth chapter of the <hi>Proverbs:</hi> No man but would wish to be in
<hi>Abels</hi> case, to enjoy everlasting happinesse in heaven, and to be praised of men on earth. If the husbandman bruise the grape on purpose to make wine for the comfort of the people, they have no cause to complain of his dealing; so we are not to murmur at <hi>Abel's</hi> death, that being a righteous man, yet he enjoyeth not the promise of long life; for he is made our example as the Apostle saith; in the eleventh chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Abel <hi>defunctus loquitur.</hi> But what is that which he speaketh, <hi>Noli aemulari?</hi> That which <hi>Abel</hi> saith is, <hi>Fret not thy self, because thou enjoyest not the outward blessings which the wicked have:</hi> It was my case saith <hi>Abel,</hi> I served God carefully, yet I lived not long upon the earth, I offered unto God of the fattest of my sheep, whereby God was pleased, and yet was for that and for<pb n="415" facs="tcp:62585:238"/>no other cause hated of the world. <hi>Propter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>THat the death of Gods Saints is pretious in his sight, Psalm</hi> the one hundred and sixteenth and the fifteenth verse, it appeares as by many other arguments; so by this,
<hi>that he maketh inquisition for their blood, Psalm</hi> the ninth; for at this verse God begins to hold a judgment concerning the wicked and unnaturall fact of <hi>Cain</hi> in murthering <hi>Abel,</hi> which judgment is continued to the sixteenth verse; for the ninth conteins an Inquiry or Examination, the tenth a Conviction of <hi>Cain,</hi> the eleventh and twelfth the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is pronounced upon him, in the thirteenth and fourteenth he is permitted to say what he can for himself, in the fifteenth is set down his repriving, or mitigation of his punishment. But before we proceed we must call to minde that this is the second judgment which God held: The first was held upon our Parents in Paradise, <hi>Genesis</hi> the third chapter: This second is held upon
<hi>Cain</hi> out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, from whence we gather, that albeit man was now cast out of Paradise, yet not out of the compass of Gods providence; for as the Apostle saith, <hi>Though we beleeve not, yet he is faithfull and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny himself,</hi> in the second to <hi>Timothy</hi> and the second chapter; so whether we be in Gods favour or out of it, yet his providence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to us; which providence of God hath appeared in nothing so much as in the discoverie of blood;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cain</hi> not out of the reach of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note>for albeit <hi>Cain</hi> were out of Paradise, yet he was not out of the reach of Gods providence so far, but God knew well the murther which he committed, and therefore calls him to account for it; and many such testimonies doth God daily shew of his providence in the discovery of blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, which make men confess <hi>verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth, Psalm</hi> the fifty eighth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from hence we are to note, that whereas the first Judgment in Paradise was for an offence committed immediately against God himself, and this for an offence done to man; so his will is, that justice shall proceed, not only for trespasses done against himself, but when we offend one against another:
<note place="margin">Note.</note>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Commandements of the Law, God hath allowed one Table to himself and another to man, to teach us that he will call us to account, not only for the breach of faith towards himself, as he did <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> but for breach of charity one man towards<pb n="416" facs="tcp:62585:239"/>another; as <hi>Cain</hi> for the sinne he committed against his brother.</p>
               <p>The point it self is a citation or conventing of <hi>Cain</hi> by God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Judgment Seat, not by any secret or inward working of his spirit, which is the usuall way whereby God worketh repentance in mens hearts, but with his own audible voice from heaven: Out of which is offered both matter of comfort to Gods Saints, which are the posteritie of <hi>Abel</hi> by imitation; and also matter of terror to the wicked, which are the ofspring of cursed <hi>Cain:</hi> For albeit it seemed God had no care of his faithfull servant <hi>Abel,</hi> in that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred him to be slain; yet we see he takes care for his blood, so that it shall not be shed, but he will call
<hi>Cain</hi> to account for it. So that they may learn this for their comfort, that howsoever we reckon of it, <hi>Yet the death of Gods Saints is pretious and of high estimation in Gods eye, Psalm</hi> the one hundred and sixteenth; and that <hi>whether they live or dye they are the Lords,</hi> in the fourteenth chapter of the <hi>Romans, for as both our bodies and souls are Gods,</hi> in the first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the sixth chapter and the twentieth verse, so no doubt but he takes care of both; wherewithall we are to observe that God is so carefull of his servants, that he careth not for himself, to shew his care to them, for he had received many indignities himself from <hi>Cain,</hi> in that he, without any regard, offered to God that which came first to his hand, not making choice of his sacrifice as <hi>Abel</hi> did;
<note place="margin">Note.</note>And again, when notwithstanding the Sermon which God preached to him, he doubted not to proceed from one sinne to another, till at last he had murthered his Brother; but yet God calls him not to account for these, but only for the wrong which he did to <hi>Abel</hi> his Servant:
<note place="margin">A comfort.</note>and so the godly see to their great comfort,
<note place="margin">God seeth our wrong to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge it.</note>that howsoever in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of present afflictions, God seemeth to have cast off all care of them; yet he will forget himself, that he may be mindfull of them.</p>
               <p>The point of terror to <hi>Cain</hi> and his posterity is, that howsoever they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> themselves,
<hi>Psalm</hi> the ninety fourth and the seventh verse, <hi>The Lord shall not see, neither will the God of Jacob regard it:</hi> yet here we have a plain instance, that God doth see <hi>Cain</hi> murther his Brother, though he doe it in the field; <hi>He seeth Sarah laugh within her self behinde the Tent dore, Genesis</hi> the eighteenth chapter; <hi>His eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the way of the Adulterer, though he wait for the twie light, and say no eye shall see me, Job</hi> the twenty fourth chapter and he doth not only see them and their works, but <hi>videt &amp; requiret,</hi> in the second of the
<hi>Chronicles,</hi> the twenty fourth chapter and the twenty second verse, that is, as <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> affirm, <hi>Hee will after this life call them to an account, and bring them to judgment for every thing they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, be it never so secret, whether good or evill, Job</hi> chap.
19. <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes</hi> the twelfth chapter and the fourteenth verse; wherewithall we are to note, that that is here verified which <hi>Jehu</hi> spake in the second of <hi>Kings</hi> and the tenth chapter, that is, <hi>that no word of the Lord shall fall to the ground.</hi> For before <hi>Cain</hi> had committed this murther, God told him, <hi>If thou doe evill sinne lyeth at the dore.</hi> And we see here, <pb n="417" facs="tcp:62585:239"/>that albeit <hi>Cain</hi> used all the means he could to cover his fact, yet it is discovered by God; and though his sinne seemed to be asleep, while he concealed it within himself, yet God will not suffer him, but wakes him out of his sleep:
<note place="margin">Note.</note>And so we are to know, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are guilty of these or the like sinnes, that we cannot keep them so closs, but he that hath the key of <hi>David,</hi> will open the dore of our consciences, and bring them to light.</p>
               <p>The Examination standeth upon two parts, first Gods Question, and secondly <hi>Cains</hi> Answer.</p>
               <p>In the Question we shall see <hi>that the wayes of God are Mercy and Justice, Psalm</hi> the twenty fifth.</p>
               <p>First, Touching his Mercie; if we ask what was Gods intent in asking <hi>Cain</hi> this Question? we shall finde doubtless that it was not to learn where <hi>Abel</hi> was, for he knew that <hi>Cain</hi> had slain him, though <hi>Cain</hi> thought within himself that his fact was unknown to any. For his intent, St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> tells us what it was, <hi>ignorantiam si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulat, ut confessiones urgeat;</hi> and as <hi>Austen</hi> saith, <hi>non interrogantis ut discat, sed invitantis ut poeniteat;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The gate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is confession of sinne.</note>the gate of repentance is confession of sinne, and God makes as if he were ignorant what was become of <hi>Abel,</hi> that so he might provoke
<hi>Cain</hi> to confess his fact, and so consequently shew himself sorry for it; for the sore or wound can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be healed so long as it is kept secret, but when it is disclosed, the Physition is willing to cure it; and as a Judge is the more provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the importunacy and obstinacie of the offendor, so nothing doth appease him so much, as when the offendor doth willingly confess his fault, and by voluntary confession shew that he hath grace. This was that which God desired in asking this Question, and the reason is, that
<hi>Cain</hi> by his voluntary confession, if he had not been hindred with the hardness of his heart, might as <hi>Joshua</hi> said to <hi>Achan, Joshua</hi> the seventh chapter, <hi>Give glory to God,</hi> that is, by accusing himself to clear God: We must confesse that we are
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it was <hi>Cains</hi> part to have confessed, that as he was the cause of <hi>Abels</hi> death, so he slew him being not inforced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; but using all means he could to dispatch him, and that God is not to be charged for his death in any respect, for that he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before by all means to diswade &amp; withdraw him from that vile fact. Touching which voluntary confession and accusing of our selves, the Fathers out of <hi>Proverbs</hi> the eighteenth chapter and the seventeenth verse, say <hi>justus in principio sermonis est accusator sui,</hi> and they read these words of the Prophet, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the fourty third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the twenty sixt verse, <hi>dic tu iniquitates prior, utjustifioeris,</hi> for the way to be justified before God, is to accuse and condemn our selves,
<hi>for it is a thing acceptable to God, that we accuse and judge our selves worthy to be destroyed for our iniquities, Ezekiel</hi> the thirty sixt chapter and the thirty first verse;
<note place="margin">Judging our selves, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Gods judgement.</note>for as the Apostle saith, <hi>the judging of our selves is the way not to be judged of God,</hi> in the first to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> the eleventh chapter, for by this means we prevent his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so that Gods intent herein was an intent of mercy, wherein<pb n="418" facs="tcp:62585:240"/>we are to observe these three qualities whereby God draweth men to repentance, <hi>his goodness, and his long suffering, and patience, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> the second chapter and the first verse, which goodness of God towards <hi>Cain</hi> appeares herein, that having already used per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions and preservative physick to keep
<hi>Cain</hi> from sinning, he contents not himself, but ministreth medicine curative now he hath sinned. Here the words of the Prophet are fulfilled,
<hi>Psalm</hi> the sixty second and the eleventh and twelfth verses, <hi>Semel atque iterum loquutus est Deus,</hi> and both speeches of mercy; the first in the seventh verse, <hi>ne peccet,</hi> the second in this verse, <hi>ut si peccasset, poeniteat:</hi> The first speech was as the Apostle speaks, in the first to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the tenth chapter, <hi>qui stat, videat ne cadat,</hi> but now that he is fallen, he speaks again, <hi>ut resurgat &amp; poeniteat, Jeremiah</hi> the eighth chapter and the fourth verse, <hi>Shall they fall and not arise?</hi> both which effects of Gods goodness the Prophet noteth in these words, <hi>Psalm</hi> the one hundred and fourty fifth and the fourteenth verse,
<note place="margin">Note.</note>
                  <hi>The Lord upholdeth them that are ready to fall, and lifteth up them that are down.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note>Secondly, his long suffering appeares in that, <hi>post tot scelera,</hi> after that he hath sinned, both against God and himself very grievously, and against his Brother, yet God ceaseth not to call him to repentance; and whereas the Lord saith, <hi>For three transgressions and for four I will not turn, Amos</hi> the first chapter and the sixt verse; yet when <hi>Cain</hi> hath sinned not three or four times, but five or six, and addeth trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression to transgression, yet still he continueth to be mercfull to him, if he would accept of it; as <hi>Job</hi> sheweth, <hi>God speaketh once and twice, and man seeth it not; in dreams and visions of the night, then he opens their eares by correcting them: Loe all those things will God work twice or thrice with a man, that he may turn back his soul from the pit, Job</hi> the thirty third chapter and the twenty ninth verse. Thirdly, to long suffering we may add patience: in that God speaks to him, <hi>non increpando, sed interrogando, medici instar potius quam judicis;</hi> and so we see Gods intent in asking the question, is an intent of mercy, that by his <hi>goodnesse, long suffering and patience,</hi> he might have drawn <hi>Cain</hi> to repentance, had he not in the hardness of his heart
<hi>heaped up wrath for himself against the day of wrath, Romans</hi> the second chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for Gods justice shewed in this Question, the advised proceeding of God in the matter of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> is a pattern for all Judges, how to proceed in judgment, namely, that albeit they know the party accused be guilty of the fact, yet they may not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against him till they have made him confesse the fact, which was the purpose of God with <hi>Cain;</hi> for so he dealt with our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in that first judgment: He knew <hi>Adam</hi> had eaten of the tree, and yet he asketh,
<hi>Hast thou eaten?</hi> in the third chapter; so he dealt with <hi>Sarah, Genesis</hi> the eighteenth chapter and the fifteenth verse. Secondly, from Gods example they are taught to proceed with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, not with a headlong and furious spirit, but with the spirit of meekness, as <hi>Joshua</hi> with
<hi>Achan, Joshua</hi> the seventh, <hi>My Sonne give</hi>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:62585:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Thirdly, from hence they have a good ground to make inquiry and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the shedder of blood, not only upon the finding of a dead body, but if the party be missing, as God, for that <hi>Abel</hi> was not present, examineth
<hi>Cain</hi> where he is, and what is become of him.</p>
               <p>Now followeth <hi>Cains</hi> Answer, wherein first generally two things offer themselves.
<note place="margin">The
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of sinne.</note>First, the nature of sinne is set out unto us, which is to draw men from one sinne to another, for so <hi>Cain</hi> was drawn from hypocrisie to envy, from envy to murther, from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hardness of heart, and so to defend and excuse his sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>This the Prophet calleth a twisting of sinne, when he saith of sins
<hi>that they weave the spiders web, Isaiah</hi> the fiftly ninth chapter and the fifth verse: sinne is like <hi>fire-bushes or thorns, that are folden one within another, Nahum</hi> the first chapter and the tenth verse; it is like the disease called <hi>the canker which fretteth,</hi> in the first to
<hi>Timothy</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter; even so sinne maketh men to proceed unto more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness, and to goe from one sinne to another. Of this we have a plain example in <hi>Cain,</hi> and not in him only, but even in <hi>David</hi> the the Servant of God, who after he yeelded to one sinne, stayed not there, but proceeded to the committing of another, in the second of <hi>Samuel</hi> and the eleventh chapter. Secondly, we are to consider the hiding of sinne, that it is such a thing as desires to be concealed, and not to be disclosed: So it was with <hi>Adam</hi> in the matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, and in
<hi>Cain</hi> in the matter of revenge, both
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<note place="margin">Note.</note>that is, we have in us not only sinfull souls, but guilefull spirits, <hi>Psalm</hi> the thirty second,
<hi>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and in whose soul there is no guil:</hi> The Prophets meaning is, that we doe not only sinne against God, but we would beguile God in hiding our sinnes from him, if it were possible, as if we were other manner of persons than indeed we be, and as if we were altogether free from those sinnes which God seeth we have committed. Therefore we are to know, that as confession is the dore to repentance,

Secondly, that it is unlawfull in that whosoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth sinne, doth that which he dare not avouch or acknowledge; for the Apostle saith,
<hi>Romans</hi> the fourteenth chapter, <hi>Blessed is he which doth not allow in his act that which he covers,</hi> for many allow and approve of that in their actions, which in word they dare not but condemn.

<hi>Eve</hi> made a confession of their fault, though it were with excusing themselves, by laying the fault one upon another; but in <hi>Cain</hi> we finde, not only an excusing of it, but an obstinate denying of it.

               <p>Of the Answer there are three parts: First, <hi>Abnegatio veritatis,</hi> in these words, <hi>I know not.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Abnegatio charitatis,</hi> in that he denyeth that <hi>he is his Brothers keeper.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Abnegatio humilitatis,</hi> in that without all modesty, he answereth by a question, <hi>Am I my Brothers keeper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first, In saying he knoweth not where his Brother is; that is a lye with two additions.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Mendacium impium,</hi> In that he lyeth <hi>not to man, but to God,</hi> in the fifth chapter of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> and the fourth verse. The Wise-man saith of Kings, which are but mortall men, in the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and the thirteenth verse, <hi>Righteous lips are the delight of Kings, and the King loveth him that speaketh right things;</hi> Then much lesse can God, which is the King immortall, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with lyes; for <hi>lying lips are an abhomination to the Lord,</hi> in the twelfth chapter of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and the twenty second verse: Hee knoweth all things, and his Majesty is greater than all the Kings of the earth: Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> prayeth, in the thirtieth chapter of the <hi>Proverbs, Take from me vanity and lyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As it is impious and ungodly, so it is foolish, in that we seek by ly es to blinde Gods eyes, <hi>To whom the darknesse is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but all is light, Psalm</hi> the one hunded thirty ninth: For the Wise-man saith, the 14. of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and the 22. <hi>Errat omnis qui facit iniquitatem;</hi> that ignorance and wickednesse are twinnes and inseparable companions, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. <hi>Cain</hi> sheweth his folly in that he believeth the Devill the Father of lyes, that he may conceal his fact from God, soe as he shall not know of it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because God might object upon his deniall, thou wast seen goe into the fields with thy Brother; since which time he was not seen: he prevents this objection, and justifieth his lye, and withall defends his sinne; for he saith <hi>he is not his Brothers keeper;</hi> that is he denieth that he is to take care of any but himself.</p>

                  </gap> to his trust: This is the law of nature saith Chist, in the seventh chapter of <hi>Matthew, That what we would have men doe to us, we doe the same to them, for that is the</hi>

                  <hi>Law and Prophets: If our neighbours oxe goe astray, or fall down under his burthen, Gods will is we succour him, Deuteronomie</hi> the twenty second chapter: Much more are we to have a tender regard of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>they are our own flesh, from whom we may not hide our compassion,</hi> in the fifty eighth chapter of <hi>Isaiah.</hi> But if that will not move <hi>Cain,</hi> yet let naturall affection provoke him to take care of <hi>Abel;</hi> because he is his Brother, issued out of the loynes of
<hi>Adam,</hi> as he himself was. Thirdly, he is to take care of him, because he is under his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As <hi>Cains</hi> position is false, so is it wicked: For if all men should take care only for themselves, and not for others, it would be the dissolution of all societie: But the law of nature willeth that
<hi>the members of the body have the same care one for another, as they have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally any one for it self,</hi> in the first epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> and the twelfth chapter. The law of the Church is,
<hi>Nemo quae sua sunt quaer at, sed quisquis quae alterius,</hi> in the first to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the tenth chapter and the twenty fourth verse: Which rule, as it concerneth all men generally, so especially it toucheth those that doe <hi>dominari,</hi> as <hi>Cain,</hi> whose duty, <hi>non praeesse solum, sed prodesse.</hi> As one private man may not renounce the care that he is to have of another privat man; so much lesse may a publique person lay aside the care of a private man. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had no care of the people, though
<hi>they perished in death,</hi> in the 13. of <hi>Hosea</hi> and the 2. verse. And when <hi>Judas</hi> came to the High Priest, and confessed his fault; They (as if they were to care for none but themselves,) answered, <hi>What is that to us? Looke thou to it,</hi> in the twenty seventh chapter of
<hi>Matthew;</hi> they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded they were not bound to take any notice of his state. These were steps of <hi>Cains</hi> sinne, and grievous sinnes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we are to consider the manner of his answer, which is not a simple deniall of his duty, but an unmodest speech, <hi>Am I my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers keeper?</hi> as if he shhold say, Am I bound to take care of my Brother?</p>
               <p>In this answer we see that <hi>Cain</hi> to his former sinnes of lying and malice, adds the sinne of pride and presumption. Of which the Prophet saith, <hi>Be not mercifull to them that offend of malicious wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> which sinne whosoever committeth, cannot be clear from the great sinne which is irremediable, as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Keep thy servant from presumptuous sinnes, so shall I be clear from the great sinne, Psalm</hi> the nineteenth and the fourteenth verse. The instruction that we are to gather hence is, that wee avoid the wayes of <hi>Cain,</hi> if we will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape his curses, in the eleventh verse of the epistle of <hi>Jude:</hi> He was carried with a lying spirit, in the first of <hi>Kings</hi> and the twenty second chapter; and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There is <hi>spiritus malignus;</hi> in the first epistle of <hi>John,</hi> the third chapter and the twelfth verse, the malicious spirit which perswaded <hi>Cain</hi> that he was not bound to take care for his Brother: Wee must take heed of that spirit like wise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:62585:242"/>Thirdly, Wee must be ware of the haughty and proud spirit, which made him answer God so immodestly; we must learn to bee humble, for, as the Wise-man saith, pride is the forerunner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.

               <p>The verse stands of two parts. First the question, <hi>Quid fecisti?</hi> Secondly, a plain detection, in the words following.</p>
               <p>For the first point, there are diverse exceptions. For the nature of this question, some make it a new question, touching the same thing that God asked in the former verses: Others referre it to <hi>Cains</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall; as if God should say, <hi>What hast thou done?</hi> in saying thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not. If we understand it to be a second question, then we are to remember what the Prophet saith, in the sixty second <hi>Psalm,</hi> that God speaketh not once but twice, to shew that he is mercifull, and that his oath is a true oath, whereby he affirmeth that <hi>he desires not the death of a sinner,</hi> in the thirty third chapter of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> and the eleventh verse; for if a man do but say, <hi>I have sinned, and perverted righteousnesse and it did not profit me, he will deliver his soul from going into the pit,</hi> in the thirty third chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> and the eighteenth verse; so greatly is God pleased when men doe willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<pb n="423" facs="tcp:62585:242"/>

The other question seemed far off from the matter, but this comes more near to the point: Wherein God doth more presse <hi>Cain;</hi> as if he should say, thou hast done this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will have thee confesse it: Which is all one with that speech of <hi>Joshuah</hi> to <hi>Achan, My son give glory to God, and confesse, Joshuah</hi> the seventh chapter: Wherein he willeth <hi>Cain</hi> to do as they did of whom <hi>Luke</hi> recordeth, that <hi>they came and confessed and shewed their works, Acts</hi> the nineteenth chapter; for it is Gods will that
<hi>we should call to minde our own deeds, before he come to set before us the things which we have done, Psalm</hi> the fiftieth. But others referre this question to <hi>Cains</hi> deniall, why didest thou not confesse thy fault, that I might have had mercy on thee? Wherein we see that verified that the Prophet affirmeth of God, in the second chapter of <hi>Joel, That he is sorry for our afflictions;</hi> and withall it is an admonition, teaching us our duties: For God maketh two sermons to <hi>Cain,</hi> one before he sinned, verse the seventh, the other after he had sinned, in these words, <hi>Ubi est</hi> Abel <hi>frater?</hi> As by the first he

<hi>Cain</hi> by murthering his brother, did not only shew himself like the Devill, <hi>that evill one,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> calls him, in the first of <hi>John</hi> the third chapter and the twelfth verse, <hi>who was a murther from the beginning,</hi> but that he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself like unto him in denying the truth, as the Devill is said to be <hi>the Father of lies, John</hi> the eighth chapter.</p>
               <p>The detection of <hi>Cains</hi> Crime is in these words (<hi>the voice of thy brothers blood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to me from the earth</hi>) God goeth forward and sheweth, that although the Devill doe stop <hi>Cains</hi> mouth that he will confess his fact, yet all is to no purpose; albeit he himself will not say he hath killed <hi>Abel, yet God setts before his eyes the things which he hath done, Psalm</hi> the fiftieth and the twenty first verse.</p>
               <p>Concerning these words there are two interpretations. First, that Gods meaning in these words is, that howsoever man needs an Accuser, yet he needs none; for he knoweth who is guilty though there be none to accuse; that man heares nothing but vocall speech but God heares blood speak, as God doth <hi>loquisurdis,</hi> so he doth <hi>audire muta; He calleth those things that are not, as if they were, Romans</hi> the fourth chapter; he makes things deaf to hear, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:62585:243"/>things speak which are dumb; as he heard <hi>Moses</hi> though he spake not a word, <hi>Exodus</hi> the fourteenth chapter. Man cannot see in the dark without the light, <hi>But the darknes and the light are all one to him, Psalm</hi> the one hundred and thirty ninth, <hi>All things are naked and bare before his eyes, Hebrews</hi> the fourth chapter, so that he needs no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser. Secondly, the other sense is the fuller and the more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally embraced, which is this; though the person guilty being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned will not confess himself, and albeit there be none to accuse him, yet he escapes not; as for the Accuser there could be none, for there were now but three persons upon earth, <hi>Cain</hi> himself, and his Father and Mother; as for <hi>Cain</hi> he denyed the deed, as for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> who were his Parents, such was their naturall affection, that they could not finde in their hearts to accuse their Son, though it were for killing a Child, that was more deer to them than he was: Of which compassion we have a like example in the Widdow of <hi>Tekoah,</hi> in the second of <hi>Samuel</hi> the fourteenth chapter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>quis potuit alter occidere Abelem;</hi> though there be neither confession nor accusation, yet God proceeds to convince him, and grounds himself upon the grievousness of his sinne, <hi>The voice of thy Brothers blood cryeth to me.</hi> This kinde of proceeding in Judgment is usuall, though <hi>Juda</hi> spake not a word himself, and there was none to accuse him, yet he was convinced by those to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens which he left with <hi>Thamar, Genesis</hi> the thirty eigthth chapter and the twenty sixt verse: And the Garments of <hi>Joseph</hi> which he left with his <hi>Mistris</hi> when she enticed him, was thought evidence enough,
<hi>Genesis</hi> the thirty ninth chapter; so we see that albeit there be neither confession nor accusation, yet God proceeds against <hi>Cain</hi> by conviction, and he doth convince him not by the voice of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which is the more usuall witnesse, but <hi>per vocem sanguinum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lessons to be learned hence are, First matter of Faith, for the ancient Fathers upon these words, <hi>The voice of thy brothers blood cryeth,</hi> compared with the Apostles, <hi>Hebrews</hi> the eleventh chapter and the fourth verse, <hi>by the which Abel being dead yet speaketh,</hi> doe ground the immortality of <hi>Abel, nam qui loquitur vivit,</hi> of which we are to be perswaded in regard of the truth of Gods promises made; for God in his first Sermon said, <hi>If thou doe well, shalt thou not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded?</hi> As for <hi>Abel</hi> albeit he did well, yet he was not rewarded in this life; therefore it followes there is another life wherein <hi>Abel</hi> must have his reward for his good service to God; <hi>For it is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble the godly, and to the afflicted rest, when the Lord shall shew himself from heaven,</hi> in the second epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> the first chapter and the sixt verse, <hi>And God is not unjust to forget our works and labour of love, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> the sixth chapter and the tenth verse. And for a third proof, if God be the God of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> as he affirmeth himself to be <hi>the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob,</hi> then no doubt but <hi>Abel</hi> liveth no lesse than
<hi>Abraham,</hi> because as Christ affirmeth, <hi>deus non est mortuorum deus, sed viventium, Luke</hi> the twentieth chapter. Secondly, hence
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:62585:243"/>we have commended to us morall doctrine, against those which doubt not without all fear to dispatch and rid out of the way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is a stay or let to them, because as they speak, <hi>mortui non mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;</hi> but such are to learn from hence, that albeit they whose blood they doubt not to spill doe not bite, yet they crye out to God for revenge even when they are dead, as <hi>Abel;</hi> for, if they crie not, the stones in the street will crie, as Christ speaks, as albeit <hi>Abel</hi> be dead, yet the voice of his blood cryeth to God for vengeance.</p>
               <p>Concerning which, six points are to be noted.</p>
               <p>First, It is true that the souls of them that are deceased are brought in, crying for vengeance, <hi>Revelations</hi> the sixt chapter,
<hi>How long Lord?</hi> but it is not here affirmed of <hi>Abel,</hi> that his soul in heaven cryeth for vengeance: as he kept innocency, so no doubt he kept a brotherly affect on to <hi>Cain,</hi> though he deserved it not at his hands. As <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> for vengeance, but prayed, <hi>Lord lay not this sinne to their charge, Acts</hi> the seventh chapter, and our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> the twenty third chapter, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they doe,</hi> but it is his blood that cryeth, and his blood, not <hi>de corpore,</hi> but <hi>de terra,</hi> that is, though the soul out of heaven complain not, yet his blood out of the earth shall crie to God for vengeance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His blood though it be separated from his body, and concorporate with the dust of the earth, shall crie and speak to God, &amp; if the blood of beasts offered in Sacrifice doe speak to God, so as they make him answer by fire, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of
<hi>Kings</hi> the eighteenth chapter, then much more shall the blood of man when it is shed have a voice to speak to God for revenge, and so forcible is the vocie of that blood, that there is no expiation but by blood, and the land cannot be clean'ed, <hi>but by the blood of him that hath shed blood, Numbers</hi> the thirty fift chapter: If the blood of them crie the blood of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents shall speak to God for vengeance; <hi>and so when the Israelites offered their Sonnes and daughters and shed innocent blood, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against them, Psalm</hi> the one hundred and sixt and thirty seventh verse; but the blood shed by <hi>Cain</hi> was the blood of an Innocent, even of righteous <hi>Abel, Matthew</hi> the twenty third chapter, and therefore must needs receive an answer sooner from God than the blood of beasts, <hi>Revelations</hi> the sixteenth chapter and the sixt verse, and the ninteenth chapter and the second verse.</p>
               <p>The third point is, that the word <hi>blood</hi> is expressed in the plurall number <hi>sanguinum clamantium,</hi> to note that in killing

Secondly, the sinne of <hi>Sodom</hi> against nature, which cried to God for vengeance, <hi>Genesis</hi> the eighteenth chapter; which by the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the punishment appeareth how filthie it was, for it was puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with stinking brimstone, as the sin it self above all others doth most stinck before God. Thirdly, the oppression of the poor, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus</hi> the second chapter and the twenty third verse, which crieth to God:
<note place="margin">Note.</note>for as God plagued the Egyptians for oppressing the poor Israelites, so he will plague them that oppress the stranger and poor, <hi>Exodus</hi> the twenty second and the twenty first verse.

The sixt point is that which maketh it up sure; for where there is no voice of any Cryer, be he never so strong, that can be heard up to the top of high hills or steeples, the voice of this crie is heard higher than any hill or tower whatsoever; it is heard <hi>de terra ad me,</hi> saith God, it pierceth the very heavens; <hi>ecce quous<expan>

               <p>For first, This is a great mercy to <hi>Cain,</hi> that where God did not take this judiciall course with <hi>Korah,</hi> for resisting the Magistrate of Gods people, but caused the earth presently to swallow him up, in the sixteenth chapter of <hi>Numbers;</hi> and punished <hi>Ananias</hi> with sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death, for that <hi>he lyed not to men but to God, Acts</hi> the fifth chapter, and never stayed either to see whether he would confesse, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him; yet he will not proceed against <hi>Cain,</hi> till he have proved him guilty, and condemned him accordingly.</p>
               <p>Of Gods proceeding in justice against <hi>Cain,</hi> there are three parts. First, the spirituall part, against his soul. Secondly, the Oeconomicall part, against his labour bestowed in tilling the earth. Thirdly, his Politicall punishment, which standeth herein, That <hi>he shall be an exile and Vagabond on earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first part of his punishment is in these words (<hi>Cursed art thou from the earth:</hi>) for Gods meaning herein (as <hi>Cain</hi> himself doth apprehend it, verse the fourteenth) is, that <hi>Cain</hi> is cast out from the earth, and from the presence of God; that is, God doth inflict upon him an Ecclesiasticall severing from Gods presence; not from the presence of his Providence, for of that, <hi>Psalm</hi> the one hundred thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ninth,
<hi>Whither shall I goe from thy presence?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Presence of Gods favour.</note>but from the presence of Gods favour and grace, of which the Prophet prayeth, <hi>Cast me not from thy presence, Psalm</hi> the fifty first, from the fellowship of the Saints, as in saying, <hi>Cursed art thou from the earth,</hi> he pronounceth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the sentence of Banishment out of the society of men. As God doth separate <hi>Cain</hi> out of the family of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Church, wherein he heard Gods word; so also he doth baniish him out of the company of men.</p>
               <p>Touching the first point, we know that it is the highest punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can be inflicted, to be cursed of God; for in the third of
<hi>Genesis,</hi> and the fourteenth verse, the sentence pronounced upon the Serpent was, <hi>Cursed art thou;</hi> if there had been any punishment more grievous, doubtlesse God would have laid it upon him. And in the end of the world, the last and most fearfull punishment, or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon the Devill and his Angels, is, <hi>Ite maledicti, Matthew</hi> the twenty fift chapter: Especially, when the curse is directed to the person, <hi>maledictus tu,</hi> as if it were shot out of purpose against him; so he directed the curse to the Serpents person, <hi>Genesis</hi> the third chapter and the fourteenth verse,
<hi>Cursed art Thou above all cattel:</hi> But when God came to <hi>Adam,</hi> he spared his person, and laid the curse upon the earth, <hi>Maledicta terrapropter te, Genesis</hi> the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the seventeenth verse: But here we see the sentence is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against <hi>Cain's</hi> person, (as it was against the Serpent,) <hi>Curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed art Thou from the earth:</hi> Wherein we may see that <hi>Cain's</hi> sinne is another manner of sin than
<hi>Adam's,</hi> and therefore is more grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished, as it standeth with justice, <hi>

<hi>Adam's,</hi> five wayes.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Adam's</hi> sinne proceeded out of concupiscence, but
<hi>Cain's</hi> came of malice, which deserveth no mercy, as the Prophet sheweth, <hi>Psalm</hi> the fifty ninth, <hi>Be not mercifull to them that sinne of malicious wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Adam's</hi> sinne was committed upon a sudden, and did not take root as <hi>Cain's</hi> did; for his sinne was a long time hatching and breeding; for all Gods preaching to him, yet he went forward in sinne, albeit he had long admonition from God to keep him from it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Adam</hi> having committed his sinne, was taken with fear, and fled to hide himself if he could; but <hi>Cain</hi> was not a whit afraid, but faced it out, and never shewed any sorrow for it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when <hi>Adam</hi> was examined he confessed his sinne wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly; but <hi>Cain</hi> obstinatly denyed it, and would not be brought to confesse it, though God had three times laboured to make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse: He denieth his fault, <hi>non tam audacter quam procaciter.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Adams</hi> sinne and <hi>Cains</hi> are not both of one regard or nature, and therefore must not be punished alike, but the one more grievou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly than the other. So yet we see here is a great correspondencie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Serpents sinne and <hi>Cain's;</hi> for as the Serpent of envy murthered our first Parents; so <hi>Cain</hi> is here the instrument of the Serpent to kill
<hi>Abel,</hi> for that he envyed him: And therefore the Wise-man said,
<hi>Invidiâ Diaboli intravit mors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, As the Devils sinne is pride, <hi>Ero similis altissimo, Isaiah</hi> the fourteenth chapter &amp; the fourteenth verse; so <hi>Cain</hi> shewed his pride by his contempt of Gods word &amp; command, who forewarned him, not to kill his Brother; as also by his saucy answer to God, <hi>Am I my Brothers keeper?</hi> Wherefore as <hi>Cain's</hi> sinne is equall to the Serpents sinne; so he hath the same punishment that the Serpent had,
<hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus tu.</hi> In regard of which likenesse of their sinne, the Apostle saith, <hi>Cain</hi> is <hi>ex maligno illo,</hi> in the first of
<hi>John</hi> the third chapter and the twelfth verse; that is, rather the Son of the Devill than of <hi>Adam:</hi> and therefore the Son is punished with the like punishment that was laid upon the Father.</p>
               <p>For the contents of the word <hi>Maledictus:</hi> The nature of a curse is, That the party upon whom it is pronounced must be evill, as the Prophet saith, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the third chapter, and the eleventh verse,
<hi>Dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te justo quia bene, vae autem malo quia male;</hi> especially that party is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that hath no good in him, for wee see, in the eighteenth chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> if there had been any good in <hi>Sodom, but five persons, the Lord would have spared it;</hi> but because there was no good in it, it was plagued with <hi>fire and brimstone,</hi> which doth most of all resemble hell. But on the other side, because <hi>there was wine found in one clust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Lord said destroy it not, Isaiah</hi> the sixty fifth chapter, and the eighth verse.

<hi>Were they ashamed when they had commitied sinne? Nay, they were not ashamed;</hi> and for confession he would make none, of whom that is verified,
<hi>periit confessio, Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> the seventh chapter and the twenty eighth verse. Whereas the patience &amp; long suffering should have lead them to repentance, <hi>Cain</hi> found nothing in himself, <hi>but had an heart that could not repent, Romans</hi> the second chapter, in regard whereof the sentence of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon him is just. Secondly, it is just in that it is a severing of <hi>Cain</hi> from Gods favour; for as <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith,

<hi>Judges</hi> the tenth chapter and the thirteenth verse, <hi>They have forsaken me and served other Gods: Goe and crie to them, let them deliver you;</hi> and as the incestuous Corinthian had made a league with Satan, so the Apostles will is, <hi>ut tradatur Satanae,</hi> in the first epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the fift chapter, and this separation from Gods favour is from his presence, which he sheweth to his people that meet together to praise and pray to him, and to hear his Word, and be partaker of his Sacraments; of which presence he giveth this command; <hi>Seek ye my face;</hi> to which the Prophet saith, <hi>Thy face Lord will I seek, Psalm</hi> the twenty seventh and the eighth verse, wherewith agree the Apostles words, in the second to the

                  </gap>, <hi>id est,</hi> in the face, fight, or presence of Christ: and as he was cursed from the presence of God, so we see <hi>he went out presently from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the Land of Nod, Genesis</hi> the fourth chapter and the sixteenth verse. This is the effect and summe of that part of the Sentence which is ecclesiasticall or spirituall, touching his soul; for all that remains, contains that part of the Sentence which is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial, where we see it was Gods will, that he which had shewed himself savage towards mankinde in killing his Brother, should be banished from the company of men. So that when it is said, <hi>Cursed art thou from the earth which hath received thy Brothers blood from thy hand:</hi> The meaning is, he shall be cast out of his own Country, whereby God doth plainly expresse thus much, That wilfull mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be punished by casting out both from Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, both from the Communion of Saints and the Society of men: For envy is a sinne of such nature, that God thinking hell not to be a sufficient punishment for it, causeth <hi>Cain</hi> to consume himself on earth with vexation of minde; for as the Wise-man saith, <hi>The effect of envy is the rotting of the bones, Proverbs</hi> the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter and the thirtieth verse.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God sets down a reason why the earth should detest

First, For that there is a wrong done to the earth when a man is wilfully murthered; that is, she is bereaved of one of those that should till and dresse it, and of one of her Inhabitants. It is the reason why the Crowners sit upon those that wilfully make a way themselves, for they are no lesse injurious to the earth than they that kill others. Secondly, Because the earth must needs abhorre that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature, and doth violate the course of nature; for nature doth will all men to seek the safety and preservation of others, but <hi>Cain</hi> wickedly and unnaturall sheddeth the blood of his Brother, which God doth

<hi>Samuel,</hi> the twenty first chapter and the tenth verse; wherein the earth it self, void of sense, appeared more kinde to <hi>Abel</hi> than
<hi>Cain;</hi> for as the Wise-man saith, <hi>God will arm his creatures to be revenged of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> in the fift chapter of the <hi>Wisedome of Solomon</hi> and the tenth verse; <hi>omnis creatura ingemescit, Romans</hi> the eighth chapter, they shall all grieve and abhorre that act which is unnaturall. As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the blood it self cried to God for vengeance, so here the earth it self receives the blood into her bosom, which was so unnaturally shed; and these are two witnesses, by whose testimony <hi>Cain</hi> is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently convicted of his sinne, and howsoever they be dumb in themselves, yet they have a voice which God heareth; so that no man can keep his sinne so secret but it will be revealed, as <hi>Job</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, <hi>Job</hi> the thirty first chapter and the thirty eighth verse; <hi>My land will crie against me, and the furrowes thereof will complain together, if I have eaten the fruits thereof without silver.</hi>

               <p>Which detestation conceived by the earth against the fact of
<hi>Cain,</hi> is further set forth in the next verse, two waies, First
<hi>negando cibum,</hi> Secondly <hi>negando sedem;</hi> for the first it is said, when thou tillest the earth it shal not yeeld her strength unto thee, to feed thee. Secondly, thou shalt be in contiuall feare, and it shall deny it self to thee, not affording thee any certain mansion, <hi>for thou shalt be an Exile and Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond upon earth.</hi> All that the earth affords us is,
<hi>pabulum &amp; latibulum,</hi> that is, as the Apostle speaks,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the first to
<hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> the sixt chapter, it doth both <hi>alere &amp; sustinere.</hi> Two things we desire on earth, sufficiencie of living and maintenance, and peace and rest against trouble. Against these two are set for
<hi>Cains</hi> punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, First want, <hi>in that the earth shall deny its strength;</hi> and unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or restlesness, <hi>in that he shal be an Exile and Vagabond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For sufficiencie of feeding, albeit God before had cursed the earth, yet not so, but that by labour it should yeeld to man bread; but now God saith, if <hi>Cain</hi> labour and take never so great pains in
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:62585:247"/>tilling the earth, his labour shall be in vain; though he sweat and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour never so much, yet it shall withdraw that humor and fatness, whereby it is wont to send forth corn for food; that is, her fruit shall not make bread, and maintain the life of him that is a shedder of blood: So whatsoever <hi>Cain</hi> enjoyeth upon earth, is not of right; for except the earth be willing both to feed him and to sustain him, he hath no just possession or interest in it, <hi>&amp; quodjure non possidetur, furto &amp; latrocinio usurpatur;</hi> every peece of bread that <hi>Cain</hi> and all those that walk in his way doe eat, they eat it wrongfully, and shall make and an account for it, as if they had stolen it. So that though <hi>Cain</hi> speak never so much <hi>to the corn, and wine, and oyle, and they in his behalf call to the earth, and the earth to the heavens, and the heavens crie unto God,</hi> yet there shall be no answer for his relief, <hi>Hosea</hi> the second chapter and the twenty first verse, but they shall all con pire and plague
<hi>Cain</hi> for his sinne. <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>If I have eaten the fruit of the earth without silver, or grieved the soules of the Masters thereof, Job</hi> the thirty first chapter and the thirty ninth verse, to shew us there is a right, not only of labour, but of person; for <hi>Adam</hi> may eat of the fruits of the earth, by right of his labour bestowed in dressing it; but
<hi>Cain</hi> for that he is a person accursed, cannot eat thereof. God gives
<hi>Adam</hi> food upon condition of his labour, but food is denyed to
<hi>Cain</hi> though he take never so much pains; for that <hi>Cain</hi> is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son accursed by God, and hath no part in that blessed seed, <hi>in whom all the promises of God, touching this life and the life to come, are yea and amen,</hi> in the second to the <hi>Corintbians,</hi> the first chapter and the twentieth verse.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As we desire sufficientie of living against want so we desire rest and quietness from trouble; and this we desire rather than the other, <hi>For a little with the fear of the Lord is better than great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with trouble, Proverbs</hi> the fifteenth chapter and the sixteenth verse; but as the earth denyed him sufficiencie, so it will not afford him a dwelling place to rest in.</p>
               <p>Of these words there are two constructions, and both profitable.</p>
               <p>First, The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> these words (<hi>Vagabond</hi> and <hi>Runa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi>) <hi>gemens &amp; tremens,</hi> that is in grief and feare shalt thou be all the daics of thy life, without any certain dwelling to rest in. He that is in grief is heavie and burthensom to himself, but he that is in fear is suspicious of others, which is a great vexation; which kinde of punishment is laid upon them that keep not Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, that they shall be smitten with searefulness, they shall fly at the shaking of a leaf, <hi>Leviticus</hi> the twenty sixt chapter and the sevententh verse, <hi>They shall flye when no man pursueth, Proverbs</hi> the twenty eighth chapter. And albeit they goe from place to place seeking for rest and peace, yet <hi>non est pax impiis, Isaiah</hi> the fifty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter. Of this Fear we have an example in <hi>Cain,</hi> who being guilty of the breach of Gods Command, confessed, that he was now in that case, <hi>that whosoever shall finde him might kill him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:62585:248"/>Secondly, The other sense which they gather of these words, that where there are but two places for men to rest in, either his own native Country, or some other where he can be: <hi>Cain</hi> shall tarry neither in his own Country, nor in any other, but shall

And this is the case of an evill conscience, not to rest any where; for to a good conscience <hi>Angulus sufficit,</hi> but for him that hath a bad conscience, <hi>ipse mundus angulus est:</hi> Therefore we are to think of these things when we begin to commit any sins, namely, that thereby we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our selves both of living and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>Apocalyps</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter and the twenty first verse; so that there is hope for sinners so long as God suffers them to continue upon earth: for if God would not have <hi>Cain</hi> repent, he should have been presently swallowed up of the earth as <hi>Korah</hi> was, and have dyed suddenly as
<hi>Ananias</hi> did: Therefore this <hi>super terram</hi> is a mercy. It sheweth also that all <hi>Cains</hi> care was set upon earth,

And they that turn it punishment for sinne, doe thereby expresse
<hi>Cain's</hi> murmuring against God: They that turn it for sinne doe shew
<hi>Cain's</hi> desparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I rather follow that in the Margent,

               <p>In which words generally, wee see a new <hi>Cain,</hi> for no man would imagine that <hi>Cain,</hi> who a little before answered God so presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, would submit himself so gently, that he which said, <hi>I know not where my brother is,</hi> would now upon the sudden confess his fact; that he that before was so bold, should now become so dejected, in the sight of his sinne; he that had shewed himself a gyant, should so suddenly become a Peasant; but it is not <hi>Cains</hi> case only, but the case of all his progenie; For
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> that so proudly and boldly said, in the fifth chapter of

<hi>Cain</hi>'s offering, he may say with the Prophet, in the fift chapter of
<hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and the thirty first verse, <hi>Quid fiet in novissimo?</hi> For if our case were as <hi>Cains</hi> was, that no man should stand in our way, but presently we might be revenged of him without danger, it were a thing to be liked; but wee see <hi>Cain</hi> himself doth not escape unpunished. Who would not desire to be in their case, of whom <hi>Job</hi> speakes, in the twenty first chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> and the seventh verse? <hi>If their flourishing estate would hold, which live and wax old and grow in wealth, their seed is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in his sight, and his generation before their eyes:</hi> But that which maketh their condition miserable, is that which followeth in the thirteenth verse, <hi>They spend their dayes in wealth, and suddenly they goe down to the grave.</hi> The Prophet confesseth he was greatly disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the prosperity of the wicked, <hi>till he went to the Sanctuarie of God; for there he understood their end, that they are set in slipperie places, Psalm</hi> the seventy third. So albeit <hi>Cain</hi> had the dominion over his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and slew him, thinking none would call him to account for it; yet wee see at length he acknowledgeth his sinne, and affirmeth it to be so great as that it can have no pardon.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if we will judge rightly of <hi>Cain,</hi> whom we have heard before what he was; we must not stay there, but read on forward, and see what he is now: For we must judge of the wicked by their deed; &amp; of them our Saviour Christ saith, in the 12. chapter of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Their end is worse than their beginning:</hi> Before his sin lay still, and his condemnation slept: And thus it is with the wicked, that while they are asleep in sinne, they will believe nothing, nor give credit to any word of God. Wherefore we see a plain example in <hi>Lot's</hi> sons in law, in the nienteenth chapter of
<hi>Genesis,</hi> and the fourteenth verse, when he told them the Lord would destroy the City, he seemed to them to be som jester: And when sinne awaketh, and damnation sleepeth no longer, then it is a matter of earnest; it maketh
<hi>Cain</hi> to cry out, <hi>My sinne is greater than can be pardoned.</hi> And howsoever <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau</hi> contemn his Birth-right, yet, when he seeks, it cannot be had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>it maketh him weep bitterly, Genesis</hi> the twenty fifth chapter, and <hi>Hebrews</hi> the twelfth chapter: So that albeit at the first, they see not the inconvenience and danger of sinne, yet <hi>in novissimo, Jeremiah</hi> the thirtieth chapter, and the twenty fourth verse, at the last day they shall understand it plainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:62585:249"/>Touching the words themselves, here is a confession, though it be faulty, for true confession hath prayer joyned with it, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, having made confession of his sinne, saith, <hi>For this cause I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Psalm</hi> the thirty second; And <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus, Pray if the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee,</hi> in the eighth chapter of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> and the twenty second verse; but this confession hath no prayer, and therefore is faulty.</p>
               <p>But to speak so much of it as is good in his confession.</p>
               <p>First, he confesseth his sinne, not every sinne, but his crooked and perverse sinne, such as <hi>Job</hi> speaketh of, in his thirty third chapter, and the twenty seventh verse, <hi>I have sinned and perverted righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, in that he saith, <hi>his sinne is great,</hi> he sheweth that he felt the weight of it, and doth not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it, and make it lesse than it is: This confession is well, but only for two exceptions that are easily taken against it.</p>
               <p>First, that which <hi>Chrysostome</hi> maketh, That it was too late, for it should have stood in the eighth verse; for as the Wise-man saith, in the eighteenth chapter of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and the seventeenth verse,
<hi>Justus in principio sermonis accusator sui.</hi> And as the fathers read, in the fourty third chapter of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and the twenty sixth verse,
<hi>Die tu ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitates prior, ut justificeris;</hi> for we may not foreslow the time, but <hi>seek the Lord while he may he found, Isaiah</hi> the fifty fift chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because albeit it be said of repentance, <hi>Siver a nunquam sera;</hi> yet <hi>si sera rarò vera,</hi> if it be late it is seldom true.</p>
               <p>And this confession of <hi>Cain,</hi> as it is no true confession, for that it was long deferred; so chiefly for that it was a confession without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny petition or prayer for pardon; and he made no prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had no hope; and no hope, for that he wanted faith. We must therefore beware that we deferre not our confession and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but speedily return to God, for that is the cause that he bears with us; he might presently consume us after we have sinned, but he spareth us for repentance, as the Prophet speaketh, in the thirtieth chapter of <hi>Isaiah, Expectat Deus ut miseriatur,</hi> and his mercy is extended to all sinners, upon condition of repentance. Albeit <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> were a grievous sinner, yet the Prophet telleth him, in the fourth chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> if <hi>he break off his sinnes by righteous dealing, and his iniquities by mercy to the poor, Erit sanatio erroris.</hi> And the Prophet to them that had given themselves to Idolatrie, saith, <hi>If you turn, your iniquitie shall not be to your destruction, Ezekiel</hi> the eighteenth chapter, and the thirtieth verse: Therefore the Godly man saith, <hi>Wee have trespassed against God, wee have taken strange wayes, yet now there is hope in</hi> Israel <hi>for this, Exodus</hi> the tenth chapter, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verse; Which is a point very materiall, for if hope of mercy and forgivenesse be cut off, sinners will fall into their case that said desperatly, in the eighteenth chapter of
<hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and the twelfth verse, <hi>We will walk in the stubbornesse of our hearts;</hi> or else as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaketh, <hi>They will be swallowed up of too much heavinesse,</hi> in the first epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the second chapter; that is, without hope
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:62585:250"/>of mercy, men fall into desperate hardness of heart, or into desperate fear &amp; sorrow, so as they cannot be comforted: And this is it which the Devill desires, to the end he may bring this to pass. As in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning he took exception against one tree, &amp; charged God with nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardliness &amp; envy, albeit he could not charge God for all the trees of the Garden, in the third chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and the fift verse; so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be impossible for the Devill to perswade <hi>Cain</hi> that God will not forgive sinnes, because in as much as if <hi>God be extream to mark what is done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> there of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and such a one as denyeth the deed with such presumptuous and proud answers, cannot have pardon. But the error of <hi>Cain</hi> stands herein, not that he is perswaded that his sin is great, for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no doubt is a great sinne, but that he thinketh it so great, as <hi>it could not be pardoned;</hi> as if Gods mercy were not great enough for his sinne were it never so great; <hi>Cain's</hi> error then as we see, is <hi>Major iniquitas quàm propitiatio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which error God doth most of all detest:</p>
               <p>First, for that it doth prejudice his Power, as if he that is Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were not able to pardon the sinnes of wicked men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It doth prejudice his truth, for God affirmeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>That he forgiveth iniquity, transgression and sinne, Exodus</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fourth chapter, and the seventh verse, which is the sinne that
<hi>Cain</hi> speaketh of here. The Prophet saith of God, in the one hundred and thirtieth <hi>Psalme, He shall deliver Israel from all his sinnes; He hath shut up all under sinne, that he may have mercy over all, Romans</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter: And as he came into the world to save sinners, so <hi>primos peecatorum,</hi> in the first epistle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> the first chapter, and the sixteenth verse: This <hi>Cain</hi> could not be ignorant of, having heard of the promise which God made, <hi>That the seed of the woman should break the Serpents head,</hi> that is, (as we have shewed,) the head and chief sinne that the Devill can infect the soul of man withall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This error doth derogate from his goodnesse, which makes it more odious to God; for Gods mercy hath a preeminece above his justice; <hi>Psalme</hi> the one hundred fourty fifth, <hi>his mercy is above all his workes;</hi> And as the Apostle saith, in the second chapter of
<hi>James, Mercy triumpheth over Justice:</hi> Therefore the sin against Gods Mercy is more grievous.</p>
               <p>Again, It is the more odious in Gods eyes, because it takes from him the Glory of his Mercy, which is essentiall and naturall in God; for his Justice groweth out of man; and he is said to be just, not so much in regard of himself, as in respect of his dealing towards men, in that he rewardeth the good, and punisheth the bad; But as for Mercy, it is naturally in him, and a part of his Essence; But his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice<pb n="439" facs="tcp:62585:250"/>commeth from without; for when men provoke him by their sinnes, then he saith,
<hi>Isaiah</hi> the twenty eighth chapter and the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse,
<hi>Judgment will I lay to the rule, and righteousness to the ballance.</hi> Therefore if we conceive of God as a hard Lord, whereas we see he is ready to forgive ten thousand talents to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Matthew</hi> the eighteenth chapter, or think him to be a hard Father, whereas he is most kinde to naughty and unthrifty Sons, <hi>Luke</hi> the fifteenth chapter: We doe derogate against his mercie and goodness, who in respect of his naturall inclination to mercy, is called mercy, <hi>Psalm</hi> the fifty ninth and the seventeenth verse; wherefore as the Apostle said to the Jewes, <hi>Acts</hi> the thirteenth chapter and the fourty sixt verse; <hi>Seeing you have put the word of God from you, and judged your selves unworthy of eternall life;</hi> so if any man by taking an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> opinion of Gods mercy, doe put it from him, and judge himself unworthy of mercy, there is no hope that he shall ever obtain forgiveness, but he must either fall into that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparare hardness of heart, that is mentioned, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter, or else be continually tormented with a <hi>wounded spirit, Proverbs</hi> the eighteenth chapter, <hi>and be swallowed up of heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> in the second to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the second chapter.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Cains</hi> conceit, it is certain if his sinne cannot be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, it is either in regard of the sinne it self, or of Gods justice; but neither of these are any such hindrance, that they ought to draw us to that which <hi>Cain</hi> saith.</p>
               <p>Touching sinne, it is not a thing impossible to obtain pardon for it.</p>
               <p>First, Because sinne is the work of a Creature which is finite, and therefore can doe nothing but that which is finite; <hi>But God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and of his greatness there is no end, psalm</hi> the one hundred and fourty sift: And therefore look how much God is greater than man, so great is his power to thew mercy; and consequently it is not possible that his mercy should be overcome of our sinne and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>peccatum hominis est infirmitas hominis,</hi> that is, sinne is a work of infirmitie, and consequently it cannot overcome Gods power; <hi>for the weakness of God is stronger than the strength of man,</hi> in the first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the first chapter; but there is no reason to say or think that the weakness of man is stronger than the strength of God; and therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>Romans</hi> the third chapter,
<hi>Can the unbelief of man, which is an infirmite of man, make the faith of God of none effect?</hi> It is not possible: <hi>Though we be unfaithfull, yet he abideth faithfull, and cannot deny himself,</hi> in the second to
<hi>Timothy,</hi> the second chapter and the thirteenth verse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas sinnes are said to be great, so the number of them how great or many soever they be, yet we are not to doubt but there is pardon for them; for there is mercy offered where there is multiplicitie of sinne. Christs counsell is, <hi>Be ye mercifull as your heavenly Father is mercifull, Luke</hi> the sixt chapter: and we see that<pb n="440" facs="tcp:62585:251"/>mans mercie is so great, that it forgiveth those that doe offend
<hi>seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times seven times, Matthew</hi> the eighteenth chapter and the twenty second verse; therefore Gods mercy must needs be greater: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, to shew the greatness of his mercy, saith, <hi>Howsoever man will not receive his wife when she goeth from him, and becommeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans; yet turn ye to me, and I will receive you to favour, Jeremiah</hi> the third chapter and the first verse: So we see that Gods mercy exceeds mans mercy. But the reason why we despair of pardon upon the sight of our sinnes is, for that as the Prophet speaketh, <hi>Mans thoughts are not as Gods thoughts, Isaiah</hi> the fifty fift chapter: man thinks that unpossible to be numbred, which God doth num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <hi>David,</hi> to shew that his finnes were innumerable, saith,
<hi>they are more than the hairs on his head, Psalm</hi> fourtieth and the twelfth verse; and yet Christ saith <hi>that our heavenly Father doth number all the hairs of our head, Matthew</hi> the tenth chapter and the thirtieth verse. <hi>Manasseb</hi> crieth out <hi>that his sinnes are more than the sande of the Sea which cannot be told, and yet God doth comprehend and hold it in his hand, Isaiah</hi> the fourtieth chapter and the twelfth verse: And albeit in mans judgment the Starres may seem innumerable, yet the Prophet saith, <hi>That God counteth the number of the Starres and calleth them by their names, Psalm</hi> the one hundred and fourty seventh; so albeit our sinnes seem innumerable to us, yet he can number them; and albeit we think it impossible they should be forgiven, yet God doth not think so.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Against the grievousness of sinne there is hope of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; <hi>For though they be as red as scarlet, he will make them as white as snow, Isaiah</hi> the first chapter and the eighteenth verse: As our sinne is great, so saith the Prophet, <hi>Great is thy mercy towards men, for thou hast delivered me from the nethermost hell, Psalm</hi> the eighty sixt and the thirteenth verse; and so great that he saith, <hi>Psalm</hi> the seventy first and the fifteenth verse, <hi>I know no end thereof:</hi> Therefore albeit the greatness of sinne be <hi>grande barathrum,</hi> yet <hi>major est abyssus miseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae dei.</hi> And as there is in us abundance of sinne, <hi>so in Christ we finde superabundant grace for the remission of sinne, Romans</hi> the fift chapter; but as for <hi>peccatum meum,</hi> that is, such finnes as are of the same size that <hi>Cains</hi> was, against which the Devill chiefly takes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that we should not doubt of Gods mercy, but that we may finde pardon: though our sinne be the shedding of blood, yet it is pardonable; for
<hi>David</hi> committed murther, and yet obtained for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givness, and was received to be a Saint in heaven</p>
               <p>Though a man be guilty of lying and denying the truth, yet there is mercy in store with God for that sinne; for <hi>Peter</hi> after he had denyed his Master, and swore that he knew him not, against his own conscience, was for all that forgiven: and that we should despair of no sinne to them that did shead the blood of the Sonne of God that holy and just one, and killed the Lord of life; even to those the Apostle saith <hi>Amend your lives and turn, that your sins may be done away, Acts</hi> the third chapter and the ninteenth verse; and yet<pb n="441" facs="tcp:62585:251"/>this sinne is farre greater than
<hi>Cains</hi> sinne. <hi>Jerome</hi> saith that <hi>Judas</hi> did offend God more in repelling his grace, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of his mercy after his sinne, than he did in betraying the Sonne of God: Therefore when <hi>Cain</hi> saith
<hi>My sinne is greater than can be pardoned,</hi> the Fathers say <hi>mentiris Cain:</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> saith <hi>absit, major enim est dei pietas quam hominis iniquitas;</hi> whereupon albeit <hi>Manasseh</hi> confesseth that he hath sinned above the number of the sand of the Sea, and that his transgressions are multiplied; yet knowing that Gods mercy is greater than the malice of men, he ceaseth not to crave forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and for that obtained pardon, and was received into favour.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point, he that will hold <hi>Cains</hi> opinion, doth not beleeve the promises of God, that the womans seed shall be of sufficient power to break in peices the Serpents head, but in saying <hi>his sin is greater than can be forgiven;</hi> it is all one as if he said, the malice and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Serpent is greater than the virtue and power of Christ, and contrary to that which the Apostle saith, <hi>Hebrews</hi> the twelfth chapter (<hi>that Christes blood speaketh better things than the blood of Abel</hi>) he holds that
<hi>Abels</hi> blood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> lowder for vengeance, than Christs blood can doe which crieth for mercy and sorgiveness: but it is absurd and blasphemous so to think, for it cannot be but Christs blood which is Gods blood, <hi>Acts</hi> the twentieth chapter, must have more force to intreat for remission at Gods hand, than the blood of a man can have to obtain vengeance; <hi>major enim est propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatio quam iniquitas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Justice of God which is the second hindrance, thus it stands: That which God hath pronounced cannot be recalled, but we are to see whether this hold true or no: the Sentence pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by God upon
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> was, <hi>dispone domum tuum, moriêris enim,</hi> in the second of <hi>Kings,</hi> the twentieth chapter and the first verse, and the Sentence of God to be pronounced by <hi>Jonas</hi> was, <hi>That within fourty daies Nineveh should be destroyed, Jonah</hi> the third chapter; but yet neither did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> die at that time, neither was the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh</hi> destroyed, as the Prophet had said it should. The reason is, because albeit God spake suddenly against a Nation or Kingdome, to pluck it up and destroy it; yet he saith, <hi>If this Nation against whom I have prenounced this Sentence, doe turn from their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I will repent of the plague that I thought to bring upon it,

                     </gap>
                  </hi> the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter and the eighth verse; so then Gods meaning was, that the King should die except he did repent, and that <hi>Nineveh</hi> should be destroyed if it did not repent; but they repented, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God revoked his Sentence; and therefore as <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>Luke</hi> the thirteenth chapter, <hi>Except
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> so all threathings in the Scripture goe with this condition, <hi>The soul that sinneth it shall die except it repent, Ezekiel</hi> the eighteenth chapter, <hi>and he that calls his brother fool is in danger of hell fire, except he

               <p>The point that remains is, That we consider
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the second chapter, the devises and fetches which the enemie of our Salvation useth to work our destruction; for when sinne is to be committed, he brings them to presumption; and albeit God hath threatned plagues for such and such sinnes, yet he perswades a man, as <hi>Peter</hi> did Christ, in the sixteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Matthew, Non fiet haec tibi</hi> that is before sinne is committed; but when finne is finished, and the Devill hath that he would have, then he laboureth to bring men into desperation, saying, it must needs be, and they cannot avoid the wrath and judgements of God. In the reading of the old Testament, he layeth a vail over the hearts of men, as it was with the Jews, that by the Law they might not see the grievousnesse of sinne, and so avoid the danger of it, in the second epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and the third chapter; but when he hath entised men to commit sinne, then he blindeth their eyes, that the light of the Gospell, whereby they are assured of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse of sinnes, and of the mercy of God in Christ, should not shine into their hearts, in the second to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the fourth chapter: he will neither let them see the grievousnesse of sinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they commit it, nor behold the mercy of God, after it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: Which mercy of God is so generally offered to all sorts, that even murtherers &amp; lyars, albeit they be grievous sinners, cannot despair of mercy, for we see both
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> obtained pardon, and none are debarred, but only they that say, <hi>Quid nobis tecum Jesu Nazarene?</hi> in the first chapter of <hi>Mark,</hi> and the twenty fourth verse; That which excluded the Devill himself from mercy, was this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate fear, for as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Obstinatione suâ, &amp; non enormitate sceleris, Daemon est Daemon:</hi> Even so <hi>Cain</hi> the Child of the Devill, seemeth to say thus much in this his confession, I desire no pardon at thy hands O God, because I see the greatness of my offence is greater than thy mercy: For <hi>Cain,</hi> we see what befell him, because, as the Prophet speaketh, <hi>Noluit intelligere, ut bene ageret, Psalm</hi> the thirty sixt; because he had no care to doe as God would have him, therefore <hi>God gave him up to the lusts of his own heart;</hi> and as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaketh, in the second to the
<hi>Thessalonians,</hi> the second chapter, and the tenth verse, because
<hi>when God spake to him, he believed not the truth, that he might be saved, God sent him strange delusions, that he should believe the Devils lyes,</hi> who preached to him and perswaded him after he had sinned, <hi>that his sinne was greater than Gods mercy:</hi> for if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> first harden his own heart, <hi>Exodus</hi> the eighth chapter, and the thirty second verse, it is just <hi>that God harden his heart, so as he shall not hearken to his ministers, Exodus</hi> the ninth chapter and the twelfth verse. But because the Prophet complaineth, that while he would have healed <hi>Israel,</hi> then the iniquitie of <hi>Ephraim</hi> was discovered, and the wickednesse of
<hi>Samaria, Hosea</hi> the seventh chapter: Therefore we must be heedfull, that while we seek to cure desperation, we make not a way to presumption, for that is the great sinne against<pb n="443" facs="tcp:62585:252"/>which the Prophet prayeth, in the ninteenth <hi>Psalme, Keep thy servant from presumptuous sinnes, so shall I be clear from the great sinne:</hi> This was the sinne of
<hi>Cain,</hi> and we must beware that we walk not in his way, as <hi>Jude</hi> counselleth, <hi>Quia è nimiâ spe presumptio,</hi> is the high way to desperation; therefore when we know Gods will, as <hi>Cain</hi> did, we must seek no faither, nor follow our own wisdom. It was <hi>Sauls</hi> sinne, he would be wiser than either <hi>Samuel</hi> or the Lord himself; for being commanded to destroy the Amalekites, with all they had, <hi>Saul</hi> as if God knew not what he did, takes upon him to <hi>spare the best things,</hi> in the first book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the fifteenth chapter; this was his presumption. We must beware, saith <hi>Moses,</hi> in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ninth chapter of

               <p>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:62585:253"/>For the first part, When sentence is passed upon any person, God requireth two things.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Agnitionem culpae,</hi> whereunto two things belong: That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Promissio poenitentiae,</hi> as <hi>Ezekiah</hi> promiseth, <hi>That he will walk all the dayes of his life, in the bitternesse of his soul,</hi> in the thirty eighth chapter of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and the fifteenth verse; And the Apostle saith,
<hi>That the true tokens of Godly sorrow, are to be angry, to be afraid of himself after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and to he revenged of himself for the sinne committed,</hi> in the second epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the seventh chapter, and the eleventh verse. And <hi>Deprecatio poenae,</hi> that is, petition for forgivenesse, as, <hi>The Lord be mercifull to my sinne, and forgive me my sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, God requires <hi>justificationem justitiae,</hi> that is, declare that the sentence is past upon us justly, as <hi>David</hi> doth,
<hi>Psalm</hi> the fifty first and the fourth verse, <hi>Against thee only have I sinned, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est be just when thou speakest, and clear when thou judgest.</hi> And this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hath two parts.</p>
               <p>First, That we think well of God, saying with the Prophet, in the one hundred and ninteenth <hi>Psalm;</hi> and the seventy fifth verse,
<hi>I know, Lord, that thy judgements are right, and that thou of very faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hast afflicted me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, To bear quietly and meekly the punishment that he layeth upon us, by <hi>David's</hi> example, in the thirty ninth <hi>Psalm, Tacui Domine, quia tu fecisti.</hi> But as for <hi>Cain,</hi> we see on his part, neither promise of repentance, nor petition for forgivenesse: he confesseth his fault indeed, (<hi>My sinne is greater</hi>) but it was no true confessi on.</p>
               <p>First, That it was too late, it should have stood in the ninth verse, for <hi>A just man will be first in his own cause to accuse himself, Proverbs</hi> the eighteenth chapter, and the seventeenth verse; but he denyed it proudly, and so was farre from making any promise of repentance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, No true confession, because without any petition of forgivenesse; for he concieved this foolish opinion, That his sinne could not be forgiven; as if <hi>the Womans seed had not Power to break the the Serpents head,</hi> or the blood of Christ crying for mercy of God, did not crie louder than <hi>Abels</hi> did for justice, which the Apostle saith <hi>speaketh better things than the blood of Abel, Hebrews</hi> the twelfth chapter. But as for his opinion touching Gods justice, both <hi>Cain</hi> and all others ought with <hi>David</hi> to acknowledge in every punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he layeth upon them, <hi>Psalm</hi> the one hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and the one hundred and thirty seventh verse, <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord in all thy judgments: They ought to judge themselves worthy to be destroyed, Ezekiel</hi> the thirty sixt chapter; for so did the better Thees, <hi>Luke</hi> the twenty third chapter and the fourty first verse, <hi>We indeed suffer righteously, for we receive things worthy of that we have done, but this man hath done nothing amisse.</hi> But as for <hi>Cain</hi> he maketh no such acknowledgment of Gods justice in punishing him; whereas he should have confessed he was worthily cast out of the earth, because he had bereaved the earth of one of her Children, killed a
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:62585:253"/>man, an innocent, and not only so, but a Saint, that he was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily cast out of Gods presence being defiled with blood; even as
<hi>Joab</hi> was pulled from the Altar, in the first of <hi>Kings</hi> the second chapter, as if he would pollute the Altar: For as the Apostle saith, in the first to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the fift chapter, the reason why the Corinthian was excommunicated, was because <hi>by a little leaventhe whole lump should be leavened.</hi> The other was justly punished with a life of sorrow and fear, because he had been a cause of sorrow and fear to many; yet
<hi>Cain</hi> doth none of all these, but insteed of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging Gods justice in regard of his desert, he makes it strange and wonders at it (<hi>Behold</hi>) but we are taught to think otherwise, that how grievous soever God punisheth us, <hi>yet he dealeth not with us after our deserts, Psalm</hi> the one hundred and third; <hi>We must not think strange concerning the fiery triall, as if same strange thing were come to us,</hi> in the first epistle of <hi>Peter,</hi> the fourth chapter and the twelfth verse: We must not make an <hi>ecce</hi> of Gods Judgments as <hi>Cain</hi> doth, for God is wise; and albeit the party punished be innocent, yet we are to think that God will suffer no punishment to come to him without just cause, much more ought we to justifie him when he punisheth a notorious Offender. But from this word (<hi>ecce</hi>) it appeares that <hi>Cain</hi> did not so much as conceive a right of Gods justice.</p>
               <p>The second point in justifying Gods Justice is, <hi>to bear quietly the punishment that he layeth uppon us, Levitieus</hi> the twenty sixt chapter and the fourty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> our iniquitie unwillingly, <hi>superimponitur non tollitur crux;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore first we must acknowledge in regard of our sinnes, that God dealeth more mercifully with us than we deserve. Secondly, We must bear quietly the punishment laid upon us, for out of affliction the godly gather matter of thanks. <hi>Job</hi> having all taken from him saith, <hi>Job</hi> the first chapter, <hi>benedictum sit momen domini,</hi> and <hi>David, Psalm</hi> the one hundred &amp; sixteenth, <hi>accipiam calicem salutis,</hi> he praiseth God for the cup of affliction as well as for the cup of salvation, &amp; is as thankfull to God for the benefits which he by means of affliction bestoweth upon them against their will, as for those that come to them with their will and good liking; and this is the perfection that we are to strive unto; but if we doe not at all reckon them as benefits, yet we must say with <hi>Eli,</hi> in the first of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the third chapter and the eighteenth verse,
<hi>Dominus est, faciat quod bonum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur in oculis suis;</hi> therefore the Prophet saith of him that is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to bear the yoke from his youth,
<hi>Lamentations</hi> the third chapter and the twenty eighth verse,
<hi>sidebit &amp; silebit,</hi> so must we doe and say with <hi>David,</hi> in the second of Samuel, the fifteenth chapter and the twenty sixt verse, <hi>Here am I, let him doe to me as seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good in his eyes:</hi> But <hi>Cain</hi> seemeth not thus to be affected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is altogether in the enumeration of his punishment; it is no quiet bearing, but <hi>odiosa repetitio.</hi> If this sinne were so great as he said it was, he should have done better to enter into the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<pb n="446" facs="tcp:62585:254"/>thereof as <hi>David</hi> did,
<hi>Psalm</hi> the fifty first, <hi>My sinne is ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me,</hi> so he should ever have thought of the grievousness of his sin. And touching the party killed; First it was a man; Secondly his brother; Thirdly an innocent. Again, in regard of himself, it was of envy that he killed him, not of a sudden, but by premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, after a trecherous manner, for he went with him into the fields, and there fell upon him; his sinne was the greater, for that it was an offence to God who had preached a long Sermon to him, that it was a grief to
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> a scandall and offence to all ages, who from his example might take a pattern to commit this sinne; but <hi>Cain</hi> takes not this course, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of his sinne is dispatched in a word (<hi>My sinne is greater</hi>) but he takes his punishment in pieces, and thinks of it particularly; whereupon one saith of
<hi>Cain</hi> and the wicked, that the repetition which they make is, <hi>eorum quae ferunt, non quae fecerunt,</hi> they are generall in their sinne, but particular in their punishment; <hi>For as of the abundanee of the heart the mouth speaketh, Matthew</hi> the twelfth chapter; so we may gather by
<hi>Cains</hi> words, that he thinks more of his punishment than of his fault, that which offends him, stood more in his sight, and grieved him more than that which offended God; but the godly are of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother minde, for they will be content to have the punishment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main upon them, so that the guilt may be taken away. But there is a third point in this repetition, which is a perverting of the order which God set down in giving the Sentence: God began with the &amp; curse ended with casting out of the earth; but <hi>Cain</hi> beginneth with his casting out of the earth, wherein he sheweth what is his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test grief; for if a man suffer many pains, he will speak of that first which doth most pinch him, and complain first of the losse of that thing which he doth most of all affect; in that he first complaineth he is cast out from the face of the earth, he sheweth he took more care for the face of the earth, than the face and presence of God, and it grieved him more to be deprived of the good will of men, than of the favour of God. It is otherwise with the Saints of God, for they crie, <hi>Psalm</hi> the seventy third and the twenty fift verse, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none in earth whom I desire besides thee, Psalm</hi> the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> third, <hi>Thy kindness is better than life it self;</hi> and when they come to make composition between heavenly things and earthly, we see what <hi>David</hi> saith, in the second of
<hi>Samuel,</hi> the fifteenth chapter and the twenty fift verse, <hi>If I finde favour in Gods sight, I will see the Ark again,</hi> that is the presence of God, and makes choice of that as his greatest felicity, not to enjoy his Scepter, or to be restored to his Wives and Children, which earthly men would make most account of; so the Apostle, <hi>Philippians</hi> the third chapter and the eighth verse, <hi>Esteeming all things as dung in respect of Christ.</hi> Whereby we see that as <hi>Cains</hi> punishment grieved him more than his sinne, so the earthly part of his punishment offends him more than the heavenly.</p>
               <p>One thing more is to be added, that is, <hi>Cains</hi> Commentary or<pb n="447" facs="tcp:62585:254"/>interpretation of <hi>Maledictus,</hi> for he saith that to be cursed is to be cast out from Gods presence. The presence or face of God hath reference to the power of God, or to his favour; from the presence of Gods power, knowledge, or spirit there is no escaping,
<hi>Psalm</hi> the one hundred and thirty ninth, <hi>If I climb up to heaven,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>Moses, Exodus</hi> the tenth chapter and the twenty eighth verse, <hi>Get thee from me, and look thou see my face no more; Rsalm</hi> the thirty first and the twenty second verse, <hi>I said in my half, I am cast out from thy presence;</hi> and <hi>Psalm</hi> the eightieth, <hi>Turn again O Lord, cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved;</hi> so that we must know, that albeit God be present every where with his power, yet he is not present with his favour, and not only that, but it signifieth the place where the favour and grace of God is intailed, that is, his House and Church, of which the Prophet saith, <hi>Psalm</hi> the ninty fift, <hi>Let us come before his presence</hi> (or face) <hi>with thanksgiving, When shall I come and appear in the presence of God? Psalm</hi> the fourty second; of which presence Christ saith,
<hi>Matthew</hi> the eighteenth chapter, <hi>When two or three be gathered together, I am amongst them,</hi> and the Apostle, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> the second chapter, <hi>In the presence of Jesus Christ forgive I them,</hi> that is, in the Church where God speaketh to us in his word, and we again speak to him by prayer; so <hi>Cains</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is both spirituall and ecclesiasticall, for that he is not only shut out of Gods favour, but cast out of the place where the presence of his favour and grace is shewed; and the punishment was justly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon <hi>Cain,</hi> that durst commit so great an offence in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and sight of God, and when it was committed, feared not Gods presence, but denyed it as if God knew not of it.</p>
               <p>The second point is <hi>Cains</hi> admonition, wherein the first thing to be observed is, how in this repetition it comes to pass, that
<hi>Cain</hi> saith (<hi>whosoever shall finde him will kill him</hi>), seeing in the sentence there is no mention of death? the reason comes from the guiltiness of his conscience, <hi>severiorum seipso Judicem habet

And this is a great part of <hi>Cains</hi> punishment, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there be none to kill him, yet he shall be in continuall fear of death, that a man shall not only fear Gods threatning, but his own fancy; that he shall fear not one, but every one that meets him, as if every one knew his fault; that he shall fear not only where there is cause of fear, as wilde beasts, but <hi>tuta timere,</hi> and this is a part of Gods curse, <hi>that God will send faintness into their hearts, so as they shall be afraid at the shaking of a leaf, Leviticus</hi> the twenty sixt chapter and the thirty sixt verse <hi>at every shadow</hi> as the Midianites were of their dreams, <hi>Judges</hi> the seventh chapter, <hi>and at every noise and rumor,</hi> in the second of the <hi>Kings,</hi> the seventh chapter and the sixt verse: These feares are great punishments, and arguments of a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; and this sheweth that albeit wickedness be secret, yet it will not suffer a man to be quiet: Wherein we are to observe how <hi>Cain</hi> de scribeth the state of them that are out of Gods favour, and cast from his presence, that they fear either no fear, as <hi>Psalm</hi> the fifty

                  <hi>CAINS</hi> chief complaint and petition therein impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was handled verse the fourteenth. This verse contains Gods answer, which is a yeelding or grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that petition of his, and that effectuall; for God provideth for the safety of
<hi>Cain's</hi> life, not only by his word and command, but by a visible mark which he set upon <hi>Cain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein we are generally to observe; First, That as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet tels us, in the one hundred and tenth <hi>Psalme, God dealeth not with any sinner according to his sinnes and deserts;</hi> for if <hi>God did not in wrath remember mercy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> the third chapter, he should not in justice have suffered <hi>Cain</hi> to open his mouth; for it is just that he which turneth away his car from hearing the law; when he prayeth, should not be heard, <hi>Proverbs</hi> the twenty eighth chapter and the ninth verse, <hi>That he which will not hear Gods Prachers, shall not be heard of God when he prayeth;</hi> And the Lord in the Propher saith more plainly, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter of <hi>Zechary,</hi> and the thirteenth verse, that <hi>as he by his Prophets cried unto the people, and they would not hear, so they cried, and he would not hear them:</hi> Yet not withstanding we see God is content to hear <hi>Cain's</hi> petition, and by his example, to set down a pattern unto others, that the sentence being pronounced, and the party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, yet he is to be allowed to speak.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That God having heard <hi>Cain</hi> wonder at his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if it were not proportionable to his sinne, hearing him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously recounting and remembring his punishment, where he should have thought upon his sinne, and transposing Gods order, in that he complaineth for that he is cast out of the earth, before he speaks of his casting out of Gods favour, hearing him shew plainly that he was more grieved at the penalty inflicted upon him, than the fault committed by him, and at the earthly part of his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more than the spirituall; whereas upon his own confession God might justly have said, <hi>Luke</hi> the fourteenth chapter, <hi>ex ore tuo judico;</hi> as thou confessest thy self unworthy to live, so whosoever shall finde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> shall kill thee, yet he is not only content to hear, but also to consider the voyce of his prayer,
<hi>Psalm</hi> the sixty sixt and the seventeenth verse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We set that God granteth his suit; for whereas
<hi>Cains</hi> request is, that the sentence may not presently be executed,
<hi>so that whosoever meeteth him shall kill him,</hi> God saith I will take order that thy life shall not presently be taken from thee, but I will reprieve thee to further repentance. Wherein we see as <hi>Augustine</hi> noteth
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:62585:256"/>
                  <hi>quod nunquam deo sine spe supplicatur,</hi> in as much as <hi>Cain,</hi> a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, hath obtained to be heard of God. It is verified which <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psalm</hi> the ninth and the tenth verse, <hi>Thou Lord never failest them that seek thee;</hi> and that which our Siviour Christ saith, <hi>John</hi> the sixt chapter, <hi>eum qui ad me venit non ejiciam for as;</hi> not only here we see a reprobate hath his request granted, but wicked <hi>Abab</hi> that sold himself to work wickedness, for that he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, escaped the evill which the Lord purposed to bring upon him; in the first of <hi>Kings,</hi> the twenty first chapter: and whereas
<hi>Cains</hi> life is spared, it is an argument that if <hi>Cain</hi> had asked more, God would have granted it: It was but <hi>Angustia mentis,</hi> his minde and understanding could not conceive what to ask besides the benefit of this present life: It was not the narrowness of Gods mercy, for had he asked more, more should have been granted him, for God affirmeth of his liberality,
<hi>Psalm</hi> the eighty first, <hi>Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it.</hi> Therefore by that term of expecting, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the third chapter, and hearkning, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the eighth chapter: The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the prophet is, that God is willing and ready to give more, if men will sue to him. In the mean time we see in these words a mitigation of <hi>Cains</hi> fear, whereby we are taught that God mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the punishment of those that are dejected, though he taketh it not away; for that which the Prophet affirmeth, <hi>Psalm</hi> the sixty fift, <hi>That God is the hope of all the ends of the world:</hi> is no otherwise veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of those that are out of the covenant, but in respect only of the mitigation of their punishment. For albeit those that pertain not to the covenant, have not their punishment taken away, yet it may be mitigated: So Christ saith of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon, that their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state shall be easier, and their punishment more remisse in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Matthew</hi> the eleventh chapter; <hi>and the Servant that of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance committeth things worthy of stripes, albeit he be not beaten with many stripes, as he that knew his Masters will and sinneth; yet he shall not escape unbeaten, Luke</hi> the twelfth chapter and the fourty eighth verse.</p>
               <p>The grant consists of two parts; The word or command of God touching him that shall kill <hi>Cain,</hi> and the mark which he sets upon
<hi>Cain,</hi> that he may be known from all other men: For by these two God sets down an order for the preservation of mans life.</p>
               <p>For the first, Where God saith not, whosoever killeth any man, but whosoever killeth <hi>Cain;</hi> that hath the form of a pardon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That no man should kill him wittingly, he saith, he
<hi>shall be punished seven fold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, For that no man should ignorantly kill him, <hi>God setteth a mark upon Cain,</hi> whereby he may be known from all other men.</p>
               <p>In the Command which God giveth, we have to consider his Pardon, and the Penalty threatned to him
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> wittingly kills
<hi>Cain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the pardon or mitigation of the sentence the Councell of God doth first respect <hi>Cain</hi> himself; for if God had presently swept away
<hi>Cain,</hi> upon the sentence pronounced, he could not have repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but in giving <hi>Cain</hi> a long life upon earth, that he should not
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:62585:257"/>presently be taken away, but live <hi>gemens &amp; tremens;</hi> it might at length come into <hi>Cains</hi> minde, wrastling with sorrow and fear, to say with the Church, in the second chapter of <hi>Hosea, I will return to my first husband;</hi> for as it is usuall with the people of God, after many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, to conclude upon repentance: It was the case of the lost childe, in the fifteenth chapter of <hi>Luke;</hi> for a time he bare out the miserie which he had brought upon himself, but at the last he is faint and saith <hi>redibo ad patrem;</hi> so Gods purpose in delaying the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his sentence upon <hi>Cain,</hi> was, that by a long and tedious life he might be brought to repentance: For that is it which <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> saith, that when long life is granted to a man, as it was to <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiab, Isaiah</hi> the thirty eighth chapter; the reason is <hi>ut vita sit mors peccati;</hi> but if insteed of <hi>funus peccati,</hi> it be <hi>foenus peccati;</hi> if instead of burying sinne we put it out to increase, then life is nothing else but <hi>thesaurisatio irae dei in diem irae, Romans</hi> the second chapter. This is the first part to be considered in Gods councell, that himself may be the better.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in sparing <hi>Cain</hi> God hath a respect of others; for there is not <hi>simplex contritio Serpentis,</hi> but <hi>aliquando conteritur Serpens ad pernitiem, aliquando at theriacam,</hi> that is to make treakle. Though the Serpents head be not so bruised that he dye of it, yet so as of it wholesome medicines may be made, for the healing of others though themselves be not healed; for the Apostle saith <hi>there is in us a spirit that lusteth to envy, as well as in Cain, James</hi> the fourth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the fift verse; and therefore we have need to have his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before our eyes to keep us from his sinne, for his shedding of blood is to us insteed of a bath to wash our footsteps in, <hi>Psalm</hi> the fifty eighth; that is, in this sparing there is not only a use to <hi>Cain</hi> himself to amend, but though he doe not, yet his example may cause others to amend, seeing how God doth punish <hi>Cains</hi> sinne with a miserable life, that contains nothing but fear and grief.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In this proceeding of Gods councell and wisedome, if neither of these take place, that neither <hi>Cain</hi> himself, nor others are the better for this mitigation; yet as the Woman said, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of
<hi>Samuel,</hi> the fourteenth chapter, that albeit one of her Sons had slain the other, yet she would not be deprived of him that was alive; for that she was willing that her husbands name and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> should continue upon earth: so it stood with <hi>Adam,</hi> he had two Sonnes, whereof the one was the bane of the other; and albeit <hi>Cain</hi> deserved to die presently, yet God doth not so consider the greatness of his sinne, that he will forget the nature of man which himself had created; and therefore as well to preserve mankinde, as to shew that godly posterity is not hereditarie, he suffers <hi>Cain</hi> yet to live. For as <hi>Adam</hi> had a <hi>Cain,</hi> so from <hi>Cain who was that evill one,</hi> in the first epistle of <hi>John</hi> the third chapter, Gods purpose was to derive such as should pertain to the Covenant. Of one and the same Parents, Gods will is, <hi>one shall be born after the flesh another after the spirit; and he that is born after the flesh shall persecute him that is born</hi>
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:62585:257"/>
                  <hi>after the spirit, Galatians</hi> the fourth chapter and the twenty ninth verse.</p>
               <p>As we say of his wisedome, so it stands not with Gods justice, that whosoever findes a Malefactor shall kill him; for God doth plainly expresse his will, that a Murtherer being worthy of death in himself, for all that, shall not be murthered of every one. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God saith, whosoever shall presume of himself to kill <hi>Cain,</hi> though it be with this pretence, that he is a murtherer, shall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished seven fold; for it is not in every mans power <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>: If any man have committed a crime, the Judge shall see whether he be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, and as the Judge shall judge him, so shall he be punished, Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomie</hi> the twenty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> chapter, <hi>Exodus</hi> the twenty second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Magistrate being Gods Ordinance, <hi>Romans</hi> the thirteenth chapter, hath power to put a murther to death, for he hath the Sword committed unto him for that end, <hi>But he that taketh up the Sword shall perish by the Sword, Matthew</hi> the twenty sixt chapter; For if every one that findeth a mans
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, might kill him, it would soon root out all mankinde: And that this inconvenience should not fall out, God takes order that every man shall not doe that to <hi>Cain</hi> which
<hi>Cain</hi> hath done to <hi>Abel:</hi> no man may kill a Murtherer unless he have authority committed unto him for that end. That is for his sparing.</p>
               <p>The second point is for the punishment of him that transgresseth thus, that is, he shall be punished seven fold: It is strange that be which kills a murtherer, shall have a more grievous punishment than he. The number of seven is <hi>numerus complens hebdomidem,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> punishment Gods meaning is, that he will lay a compleat and consummate punishment upon such a party; but howsoever it seem strange, yet it is justice, for that as God will not have him spared whom he condemns to death, as <hi>Saul</hi> spared <hi>Agag</hi> in the first of <hi>Samuel</hi> the fifteenth chapter, <hi>nor let him goe whom he hath appointed to die,</hi> in the first of <hi>Kings,</hi> the twentieth chapter and the fourty second verse; so it is a grievous sinne to kill him whom God will have spared; and this is it which makes the sin of such a party grievous, besides the consideration of Gods wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them that doe
<hi>addere afflictiones afflicto. Zechariah</hi> the first chapter and the fifteenth verse, God saith <hi>he will be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> that help forward the affliction of them with whom he was a little angry,</hi> and therefore such a one shall not escape, but before plagued: and the Prophet saith <hi>the Lord will not judge and condemn a man twice for one fault, Nahum</hi> the first chapter and the ninth verse. Such a man committeth a sinne more grievous than
<hi>Cains</hi> sinne in two respects. First, <hi>Cain</hi> transgressed only the Law of nature written in his heart, but the other transgresseth not only the naturall Law, but Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Command, who gave order that no man should of himself presume to kill <hi>Cain.</hi> Secondly, It is more grievous in that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>Cains</hi> example a warrant to commit murther, but God saith he must not doe so; for if a man seeing <hi>Cain</hi> punished for his sinne,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:62585:258"/>shall notwithstanding sinne as he hath done; he addeth to his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and must therefore have a greater punishment than
<hi>Cain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From those two parts already handled, we may gather, that to those that sit as Judges in Gods place, there is left a power of life and death; <hi>a power to crucifie, and a power to let loose,</hi> as
<hi>Pilate</hi> said to Christ, <hi>John</hi> the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter, verse the tenth, that they have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er both to mittigate and to abrogate the punishment of Offenders: For the first <hi>David</hi> was fain of necessity to forbear
<hi>Joab,</hi> being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self weak and old, and to delay his punishment when he had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <hi>Abner,</hi> and <hi>Amasa,</hi> men more righteous and better than he, till <hi>Salomon</hi> his sonne was established, in the first of <hi>Kings</hi> and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter. But the reason why <hi>Cain's</hi> punishment is delayed, is not any forbearance of necessity, but because the lengthning of his punishment is a better means to restrain men from the like sinne, than if he had at once been punished with death. For this cause the Prophet saith, <hi>Psalm</hi> the fifty ninth and the eleventh verse,, <hi>Slay them not least my people forget it, but scatter them abroad by thy power.</hi> It is <hi>magis ad bonum publicum,</hi> that the Offenders be spared. If
<hi>Cains</hi> life had been presently taken away, it might have been doubted whether <hi>Cain</hi> had ever committed any such sinne or no; or if they did beleeve it, yet they might soon forget the punishment laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; therefore God thought it better he should be spared, that others seeing <hi>Cain</hi> live in continuall miserie, might take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to inquire what he hath done, that understanding the cause of his miserie, they may be warned to avoid his sinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From hence is grounded the aggravation of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; so that where <hi>thest is ordinarily punished with four fold restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Exodus</hi> the twenty second chapter; He that stealeth a poor mans sheep, that hath no more, is, by <hi>Davids</hi> judgment, the child of death, in the second book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the twelfth chapter; he that finneth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contempt of Gods command, and not of any necessity, as <hi>he that gathereth sticks upon the Sabbath day, Numbers</hi> the fifteenth chapter; such a one is more grievously to be punished. When the party offended will have a man spared, then to kill him contrary to his command, is a sinne that deserves extraordinary punishment; for <hi>mensura peccati</hi> is that which brings us unto <hi>plagarum modus, Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie</hi> the the twenty fifth chapter, and the second verse. <hi>Cain</hi> being warned from the law of nature, kills his Brother, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves punishment; but he that being warned from Gods own mouth, kils <hi>Cain,</hi> doth deserve a more great punishment.</p>
               <p>But lest any should excuse themselves with ignorance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that notice may be taken of <hi>Cain,</hi> God sets a mark upon <hi>Cain: Signum in</hi> Cain, <hi>fecit</hi> Cain <hi>insignum.</hi> This mark gives all men oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to inquire who he is, that so they may be put in minde to hold their hands from off <hi>Cain;</hi> forasmuch as God will not have him to be killed by any man.</p>
               <p>There are two sorts of signes: There is <hi>Signum in bonum, Psalme</hi>

The contents of this verse are his departure. Gods purpose as we have heard both in <hi>Cains</hi> punishment, as also by gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him so much as he required, in the last verse, was to give <hi>Cain</hi> space to repent; and yet not withstanding we see plainly that is verified in <hi>Cain,</hi> which the Prophet affirmeth, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the twenty sixt chapter and the tenth verse, <hi>Let mercy be shewed to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness;</hi> For <hi>Cain</hi> instead of using <hi>the goodness, and patience, and long suffering of God</hi> as a means to bring him to repentance,
<hi>Hardned his heart, and heaped up wrath for himself against the day of wrath, Romans</hi> the second chapter and the fift verse.</p>
               <p>This departing of <hi>Cain</hi> stands upon three parts: First, his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; <hi>he went out:</hi> Secondly, <hi>terminus a quo,</hi> that is, <hi>from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> that is, <hi>the land of Nod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the first, there is a going out upon distrust, when a man hath no hope of favour; and another upon contempt, when a man thinks he shall have no benefit of tarrying. Of which the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, that going out which is upon distrust: but so could not <hi>Cain</hi> goe out; for as well by Gods mercifull dealing towards <hi>Cain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the sentence was pronounced, as also by the gracious grant which God made him, he might gather that God was well affected towards him. For as the wife of <hi>Manoah</hi> saith, <hi>Judges</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter and the twenty third verse,
<hi>If the Lord would kill us, he would not receive a burnt offering at our hands;</hi> so God would not have heard <hi>Cains</hi> request, had he not wished him well. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Austin</hi> upon the words of <hi>David, Psalm</hi> the sixty sixt and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth verse, saith, <hi>quamdiu dominus non amovet orationem a se, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> non amovet misericordiam a nobis,</hi> for that yeelding to <hi>Cains</hi> request touching his life, was an invitation to stir up <hi>Cain</hi> to desire more. Therefore <hi>Cain</hi> should not have gone out so soon as his suit was heard, but still have continued praying to God for more and better things, as
<hi>Abraham, Genesis</hi> the eighteenth chapter, hearing that God at his request was contented to spare <hi>Sodom for fifties sake,</hi> prayeth still in the behalf of the City, adding one petition after another:
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:62585:259"/>Which course the Prophet keepeth in his prayer,
<hi>Psalm</hi> the fifty first, <hi>Cast me not from thy presence, neither take thy holy spirit from me.</hi> Though he durst not pray himself, being a sinner, yet by others, as <hi>Miriam</hi> by <hi>Moses, Numbers</hi> the tweelfth chapter, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aron, Exodus</hi> the ninth chapter and the twenty eighth verse; so should <hi>Cain</hi> have done, but in as much as he doth not, his case is like the case of <hi>Esau, Genesis</hi> the twenty fift chapter, he cared not for his Birth-right; no more did
<hi>Cain</hi> take any care for the presence of God, but thought it a matter not worthy to be reckoned of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We see that <hi>Cain</hi> goeth not out against his will, nor tarries till God send him out of his presence, as he sent
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> out of Paradise, setting a Cherubim to keep the way, <hi>Genesis</hi> the third chapter; there was no such execution or warrant from God for <hi>Cain,</hi> but he first casts out himself; whereby we see it was an hypocriticall complaint that he made, <hi>that he was cast out from the presence of God,</hi> verse the fourteenth, in that he goeth out of himself without any violence offered to him: A Child will not at the first bidding go out of his Fathers presence, though in his anger he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him; no more should <hi>Cain,</hi> he should have been of <hi>Jacobs</hi> minde,
<hi>Genesis</hi> the thirty second chapter, <hi>I will not let thee goe till I have a blessing:</hi> But we see <hi>Cain</hi> doth of himself voluntarily leave Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which sheweth plainly that the cause of <hi>Cains</hi> grief, was not Gods displeasure, but his punishment laid by God upon him, and not the spirituall part of his punishent, but the earthly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the casting out of Gods presence was threatned as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and therefore ought to be born patiently, but to make <hi>poenam excommunicationis crimen apostasiae,</hi> is a great aggravation of his sinne; that is to take occasion by the censure of the Church: to bring in Schisme is a grievous aggravation of the offence. But as we have seen that <hi>Cain</hi> was the first Author of heresie; for that he thought any thing would serve Gods turn, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and meanest things were good enough to offer to him; whereas <hi>Abel</hi> offereth the best he could finde; so he is the first that brings up Schism and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy; for the Sentence is not executed upon him, but through an evil heart of unbelief, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Hebrews</hi> the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>He doth depart of himself from the living God.</hi> Soe we have these three things in his departure. First, It is not upon any just
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, It is voluntary. Thirdly, He departs so as he makes the penalty of his sinne the matter of a greater sinne. Secondly, Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his removing; to remove of it self is not evill, but in regard of the place from whence, if with <hi>Abraham</hi> we depart from a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Idolatry as from <hi>Ur;</hi> or as <hi>Lot</hi> from
<hi>Sodom,</hi> a City full of all sinne; or with the Hebrewes out of a place of vexation and cruelty; such a departure is good, but to depart from a good place, that makes the motion evill; but for <hi>Cain</hi> to depart out of the presence of God, is all one as if the sick person should leave the Physitian. St. <hi>Peter</hi> indeed in great astonishment said to Christ, <hi>exi a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>ye also goe away?</hi> his answer is, <hi>John</hi> the sixth chapter and the sixty eighth verse, <hi>Domine ad quem ibimus? tu habes verba <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap> have me depart from thee, shew me such another as thou art, otherwise I will not leave thee till thou receive me into thy favour.</p>
               <p>This presence of God was some certain place of Gods appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as the place whither he went, was a country by Paradise, called the Land of
<hi>Nod.</hi> Therefore the place whither he went, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a locall motion; the place from which he departed, must needs be likewise locall. From this place of Gods presence <hi>Cain</hi> went out, to dwell in the land of <hi>Nod.</hi> The effect of which words, is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter set down in one word; for the place wherein God appeared to <hi>Jacob</hi> when he slept, was called <hi>Bethel, Genesis</hi> the twenty eighth chapter; the same place also is called
<hi>Penuel, Genesis</hi> the thirty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter, and the thirtieth verse: so that the place of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, was some one piece of the earth, where the Altar was, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> offered their sacrifices, where God did usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appear, <hi>Even as we also have an Altar, Hebrews</hi> the thirteenth chapter, where we have Christs presence, as he affirmeth, that <hi>where two or three be gathered together in his name, he is present among them, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> the eighteenth chapter; like as they that come together to hear the word, are said to be present before God, that is,
<hi>in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, Acts</hi> the tenth chapter.</p>
               <p>The point that wee are to gather hence for our instruction, is, That we concieve of the Church, and place of Gods presence, as we doe of the place of the Princes presence; for we reverence such places though the Prince be absent; so ought we to reverence the places of Gods presence, though we have no visible apparition of his presence; for <hi>such places are his rest for ever, where he promiseth to dwell, Psalme</hi> the one hundred thirty second;
<hi>They are also his footstoole,</hi> and therefore are to be reverenced, As,
<hi>Psalm</hi> the ninty ninth, <hi>Fall down before his footstool, for he is holy:</hi> Therefore to depart from the Church is to depart from Gods presence, no lesse than <hi>Cain</hi> did: But Gods will is, we should not depart out of the place of his presence, no more than we would out of the presence of his favour: and we must make a conscience, how we goe out of such places, because God is not mocked. When men have no religion, it is said of them,
<hi>Psalm</hi> the fourteenth, <hi>They call not upon God;</hi> as for the preaching of the word, they count it <hi>onus Domini, Jeremie</hi> the twenty third chapter; It is as tedious to them to hear sermons, as to carry burthens upon their backs: And for the spirituall food offered in the Sacraments, it is to them as Manna was to the Israelites, <hi>A light meat, which their soul loatheth, Numbers</hi> the eleventh chapter. And as for the Church and Congregation of the faithfull, the opinion that the world hath of them, is very mean, as the Prophet saith, in the thirtieth chapter of <hi>Jeremiah, This is Sion, whom no man seeketh after.</hi> But they that are so affected towards the service of God, and the places of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, are <hi>animales spiritum non habentes,</hi> as <hi>Jude</hi> calleth them; they <pb n="459" facs="tcp:62585:260"/>have no favour in such things, and therefore they care not for them, but like
<hi>Cain,</hi> doe goe out of them; and make no reckoning: Of whom the Apostle saith truly, in the first epistler of <hi>John;</hi> the second chapter, and the ninteenth verse, <hi>They went out from us,</hi> yet <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for then they should have selt them when they went. For those things that are not members of the body, may easily be taken away, as the hairs of the head and the nayles; but take away any member of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and it will be painfull: Therefore they that depart willingly from the Church, and place of Gods presence, are not members but excrements of the mysticall body.</p>
               <p>The place whither he depaited was <hi>The land of Nod.</hi> As it is said of <hi>Cain,</hi> that <hi>he went out;</hi> so so also of St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> but for a diverse end; <hi>Peter went out and wept bitierly, Matthew</hi> the twenty sixt chapter; and the last verse; but <hi>Cain</hi> went not out to bewail his sinne, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, but to settle himself in some other place. <hi>Cain's terminus ad quem,</hi> is he land of
<hi>Nod,</hi> which is situate towards the east side of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>Where in two things: First, The place it self. Secondly, The si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.</p>
               <p>For the place it sell: There are of the Interpreters that take it to be no certain land, from the word <hi>Nod,</hi> which signifieth to wander; as if the meaning were, that <hi>Cain</hi> according to the sentence, that he should be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and exile, went out to wander from one place to another: But that cannot be, in as much as
<hi>Nod</hi> is said to be a land on the east side of Paradise. It is further said, that being there he built him a City, not that he stayed there, for he was alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving and fleeting from one place to another. It was before the deluge, so called of <hi>Cain,</hi> whose state of life was to wander up and down; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<hi>Babel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is said to be castward toward <hi>Eden:</hi> Wherefore by the framing of his journy to that place, which carrieth the name of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, it appeares, that <hi>Cain</hi> did not settle himself to repentance, for then
<hi>he should have gone into the Valley of Achor, Hosea</hi> the second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Or <hi>into the valley of tears, Psalme</hi> the eighty fourth; that is as far from <hi>Eden</hi> as he could; because a place of pleasure is unfit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in: He that will repent, must get him into the wildernesse alone, and there bewail his sins. He could not goe to <hi>Eden,</hi> for there was an Angel set with a shaking sword, to keep the way of the tree of life,
<hi>Genesis</hi> the third chapter; but toward the east side of <hi>Eden:</hi> So we see <hi>Cains</hi> purpose was not Gods purpose: The purpose of God in allowing unto <hi>Cain</hi> life was, that he might have time to repent: But
<hi>Cains</hi> purpose is, that he may plant himself on earth, and enjoy pleasures. These are the wayes to the which there belongeth a woe, as the Apostle sheweth, <hi>Jude</hi> the eleventh verse; <hi>The sinne of pleasure,</hi> which is <hi>Cains</hi> sinne, <hi>The sinne of gain,</hi> which was <hi>Babylon's</hi> sinne; and <hi>the sinne of ambition,</hi> which was the sinne of <hi>Korah:</hi> These are the three wayes of the world, <hi>The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes</hi>

               <p>Again, Whereas <hi>Cain</hi> being now fallen from hope of eternall and spirituall things, takes his journey to the east, we see he is the first of those that are content, even for to enjoy the warmnesse of the sunne, to leave the presence of God, and for to get a little pleasure for a time, will forgoe that which is incorruptible, and indures for ever. Such men are like those whom the Prophet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the eighth chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and the sixteenth verse, <hi>having their backs toward the temple, and their faces to the sun rising, to worship the sunne:</hi> Even so <hi>Cain</hi> by leaving Gods presence, doth give over eternall things, and seeks for temporall. And so we see what is <hi>Cains</hi> error, both in departing from Gods presence, and in removing to this place.
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> which then represented the Church, were upon the west side of <hi>Eden; Cain</hi> and his crue keeps in the east side, that is, the wicked have the better part in the things of this life, for <hi>their portion is in this life, Psalme</hi> the seventeenth; but the portion of the godly is not in the pleasure of this life, but in the land of the living; where they have laid up for them, things <hi>which eye hath not seen, the ear hath not heard, nor mans heart conceived,</hi> in the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the second chapter: The wicked in their life time receive pleasure, but after indure everlasting pain; but the godly that sufer affliction in this world, shall in the world to come be comforted, as it is in the sixteenth chapter of <hi>Luke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence we learn, That we must not depart from Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as <hi>Cain</hi> did, without just cause: If we doe, it must be to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail our sinnes with bitter tears, as St. <hi>Peter.</hi> If we goe from Gods presence, we shall finde the land of <hi>Nod,</hi> that is, a place that shall afford us no contentation or rest: It shall be with us, as it was with
<hi>Agar,</hi> to whom the Angell said, in the sixteenth chapter of
<hi>Genesis,</hi> and the eighteenth verse, <hi>Whence comest thou? and whither goost thou?</hi> So we shall be in continuall motion, and never have rest.</p>
               <p>First, Because we can never, in this wicked world, attain to any perfection of pleasure, our desires are never satisfied; for it is true of all men as one saith, <hi>quando habent quod voluerunt, non habent quod volunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Because <hi>they are all their life in fear of death, Hebrews</hi> the second chapter. We see our state represented in <hi>Jonah</hi> when he fled from the presence of the Lord; he thought he should have come to
<hi>Tarshish,</hi> but he found himself in the land of <hi>Nod,</hi> that is of thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and misery, <hi>being tossed on the Sea, Jonah</hi> the first chapter and the third verse; for Gods presence is <hi>Seth's</hi> land, that is, a land of foundation; it is the Country of <hi>Noah,</hi> for it giveth rest; it is the City of <hi>Salem,</hi> that is, of peace: But if we leave Gods presence, we shall not finde any land of foundation, rest or peace.

A fair proffer indeed is made to draw men from Gods presence, and to commit sinne, in as much as it offereth pleasure; but when they have seated themselves a little, even as neer

<hi>Nod,</hi> that is, they shall feel nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but unquietness of conscience, and without, fear and trouble, so as they shall have inducements sufficient to make them return. <hi>Salomon,</hi> the pearless example of all those that might have enjoyed pleasure, if it had been to be found; who was greater than any King that ever was before him, set himself to plant himself as neer <hi>Eden</hi> as he could, <hi>he denyed his Soul nothing that it desired,</hi> and yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, that when he had built him Houses, and planted Orchards, <hi>he found nothing but vanity and vexation of spirit, Ecclesiastes</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter and the eleventh verse, that is, his desire was never satisfied, and for the attaining of that which he had, he endured vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and trouble. As <hi>Cain</hi> had his arguments perswading him to make triall of the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> so when he was there, his trouble and unquietness were sufficient reasons to make him return to God, but we see he had no minde to return; for having disjoyned himself from Gods presence, he built a City, which is a plain argument of not returning, as the people in captivity, to let them know they shall not return of a long time, are commanded to build Houses, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the twenty ninth chapter, and the Children of God were content to dwell in Tents; they built not Cities on earth,
<hi>but sought for a City whose builder is God, Hebrews</hi> the eleventh chapter and the ninth verse, which was a plain token that they did not minde to dwell on earth as Freeholders, but to continue for a time, looking
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:62585:262"/>for a City that hath a foundation: but <hi>Cain</hi> not minding to return to God, built a City in the land of <hi>Nod:</hi> and this is the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his sinne; first in departing from Gods presence, then in planting himself so as he purposed not to return.

<hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> the fourteenth chapter.</p>
               <p>For the knowledge <hi>Cain</hi> had with his wife, we see that as <hi>Adam</hi> when he was cast out of Paradise knew his Wife; so
<hi>Cain</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Gods presence to a Land of trouble and disquietness, having lost spirituall comforts, seeks for rest in carnall delights. For the procreation of Children, as <hi>Sarah</hi> speaks,
<hi>Genesis</hi> the eighteenth chapter, is an act of pleasure, which albeit it be lawfull for <hi>Adam,</hi> a repentant sinner, yet not for <hi>Cain,</hi> being in that state that he was; for in the time of repentance <hi>the Bridegroom must come forth of his Camber, and the Bride out of her Bedchamber, Joel</hi> the second chapter and the sixteenth verse, and they that are married may not so give themselves over to the flesh, <hi>but that upon speciall cause some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they give themselves to prayer and fasting,</hi> in the first to the
<hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> the seventh chapter and the fifth verse; but
<hi>Cain</hi> standing as he did at this time, transgresseth the Command of God.</p>
               <p>And yet touching the third point, Gods goodness appeareth herein, that for all that he so blesseth
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> which was unlawfull, that she conceiveth. It was in Gods hand, and his sinne deserved it, that she should have been barren; for <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the twenty second chapter, in the second of <hi>Samuel</hi> the sixteenth chapter, the sinne of <hi>Jeconiah</hi> and <hi>Michal</hi> is the cause of their barrenness: Therefore in Gods justice it is a due punishment to all sorts not to have Children; but yet as he brings light out of darkness; so to shew he can of evill Parents bring forth good Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he gives <hi>Cain</hi> issue, as he brought good <hi>Ezekiah</hi> out of <hi>Achan,</hi> and <hi>Josia</hi> out of <hi>Ammon.</hi> For this cause he gives the wicked Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as also in this regard, to shew that he is able to break the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head, not one way only, by killing sinne in men, but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them examples of his justice, as in <hi>Pharaoh: Romans</hi> the ninth chapter, <hi>For this cause have I stirred them up,</hi> even as we see the bodies of Malefactors are given to Chyrurgeons for Anatomies, that in them men may see the state of our bodies: and so it may be for the good of others. For as it were inconvenient that evill Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents should only have evill Children, because by this means evill would be infinite; so it is as inconvenient that good Parents should have none but good Children; for so that which is of grace would be ascribed to nature: And so we see, that albeit the act be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the seed stolne, yet being cast into the ground, we see God so blesseth it that it is fruitfull.</p>
               <p>The fourth point is, that <hi>Cain</hi> called his Sons name
<hi>Enoch;</hi> the meaning whereof is a dedication or consecration: and this gives hope, as if there were some goodness remaining in <hi>Cain;</hi> for those things that are built to be dedicated, are Altars and Churches, things for Gods use, as <hi>Noah</hi> built an Altar, and offered burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
<hi>Genesis</hi> the eighth chapter, but that which <hi>Cain</hi> built is no Altar, but a City; and we know Cities and Towns are dedicated
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:62585:263"/>to the world, and the consecration that he makes is to no God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he make the world his God <hi>Philippians</hi> the third chapter; his position is <hi>that gain is godliness,</hi> in the first to
<hi>Timothy</hi> the fourth chapter, and therein he bestowes his service. But after we have another <hi>Enoch,</hi> so truly called, <hi>Genesis</hi> the fift chapter, the Son of <hi>Seth,</hi> who did not depart from Gods presence as this <hi>Enoch</hi> did, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated himself to God, and became a Preacher of righteousness; who as well by his preaching, as by uttering the censure of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, (<hi>behold the Lord commeth with a thousand of Angels</hi>) as <hi>Jude</hi> speaks, dedicated himself to the Church; but the first work that <hi>Cains Enoch</hi> sets himself about, is the world. This is the difference between <hi>Cains Henoch</hi> and <hi>Seths Henoch:</hi> the one builds a City on earth, the other <hi>seeks for a City from above whose builder is God.</hi> So that there is no hope of <hi>Cains</hi> return, he consecrates his Sonne and City, but it is to the wrong God, if to any.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Touching the building of the City, which is a matter respecting the world; before wee come to that, we must know there was now a great distance of yeeres betweene the time that <hi>Cain</hi> knew his wife, and the time that hee built the City; for hee built not the City only for himselfe, his wife and childe, but was now grown to bee so great a number that hee must have a City to place his posterity in; for God, respecting mankinde rather then the sinne of man, made the seede sowne, plentifull; They that came of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> came but to twelve, and in few yeeres, of those twelve, came seventy five, and for the increase of mankinde,
<hi>Hee makes the barren families like a flock of sheepe,</hi> as it is in the hundred and seventh <hi>Psalme.</hi> Therefore when <hi>Cain</hi> was grown to so great a multitude, he built him a City. It is true of <hi>Cain</hi> which the Apostle affirmeth, <hi>Hebrews</hi> the third chapter, <hi>No man departs from God, but by an evil heart of unbelief:</hi> So <hi>Cain</hi> thinks, that albeit God hath cursed that part of the earth where <hi>Adam</hi> was, yet it may be the Land toward the Sun rising may be better; and therefore he makes triall; like the Isrealites, which being forbidden to keep any of the Manna till morning, for all that would trie whether it would be full of worms; and being forbidden to goe forth on the Sabbath, notwithstanding they went forth to make triall, though they found none, <hi>Exodus</hi> the sixteenth chapter the twentieth and the twenty seventh verses; so <hi>Cain</hi> would trie whether there were not a plot of ground free from the curse; but not finding any such piece of ground, he turned himself to handycrafts, when husbandry failed: He and his Children fall to occupations, some work in brass, some to make Tents, and others to make Organs. That is the civill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the building of the City.</p>
               <p>The spirituall reason is, that fear is the first beginner of
<hi>Cains</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for this place though it were a place of pleasure, yet it gives him no rest, or security: therefore he deviseth to himself a new means to safeguard him from fear, that is, by building a City and walling it; that if the Sonnes of <hi>Seth,</hi> or any that were privie to his
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:62585:264"/>fact, came against him, he might be safe from them. As
<hi>Adam</hi> hid himself from Gods presence in his bushes, so doth
<hi>Cain</hi> goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to defend himself with walls: Howbeit so it is that a guilty conscience cannot finde any rest or security by any such means, but it findes the truth of that which the Apostle saith, in the second to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the seventh chapter and the fifth verse, <hi>pugnae for is, intus terrores.</hi> And yet by the taking order for the continuance of his name, it appeares he had not only fear, but a secular desire of fame in the world: he contenteth not himself with <hi>Adams</hi> dwelling, but builds a City. <hi>Adam</hi> and his Children dwelt under Trees, or some Tents; but the Posterity of <hi>Cain</hi> builds themselves Cities to dwell in.</p>
               <p>For the generall, as the beginning of good Lawes is the evill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions and naughty manners of men; so the remedy against fear is Cities, that by them people may be safe from wilde beasts, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and cruel men more wilde than beasts. But as first necessity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Garments, &amp; since pride; so it is of Cities: A City was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded first in regard of fear, but since they are become the only places of pride; for in the Country where men are imployed in husbandry we see no such pride, they content themselves with plain dwelling; but in the City all things are for pride. That is for the building of the City.</p>
               <p>Touching the Builder, we see the beginning of buildings is
<hi>homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem occidere, &amp; urbem condere:</hi> Therefore the Prophets crie out, that the faces of the poor are ground for the maintenance of <hi>Cities, Jeremiah</hi> the twenty second chapter and the thirteenth verse,
<hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk</hi> the second chapter and the thirteenth verse, <hi>Micha</hi> the third chapter: Even as we see <hi>Cain</hi> that killed his brother is the Builder of this City; so there are many like <hi>Cain,</hi> that kill and undoe a great company of young Occupiers, to build themselves a City: For they content not themselves with their Fathers Houses, <hi>but build themselves Houses of Cedar, Jeremiah</hi> the thirty second chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Out of the Builder <hi>Augustine</hi> hath this note; that as the building of this City of <hi>Enoch</hi> by the blood of
<hi>Abel,</hi> was a soretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what kinde of City this should be, namely full of cruelty; so in as much as <hi>Rome</hi> was founded by <hi>Romulus</hi> in the blood of <hi>Remus,</hi> that was a signe that it would be a cruel and bloody City, as we see it came to pass, that it hath been the chief persecuting City, and shed most blood</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We are to speak of the name, wherein the itch of
<hi>Cains</hi> vanity breaks forth; for in giving this name he saith as much as they doe, <hi>Genesis</hi> the eleventh chapter, <hi>paremus nobis nomen,</hi> he seeks to make his posterity famous, for it is the course of the world,
<hi>And men think their houses shall continue for ever, and therefore call their lands by their names, Psalm</hi> the fourty ninth and the eleventh verse: when they cannot be written in the book of life, they seek to be in remembrance of men. We see it is in <hi>Saul</hi> when God took his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor from him, he would be honoured of the people, in the first of<pb n="467" facs="tcp:62585:264"/>
                  <hi>Samuel</hi> the fifteenth chapter; so that upon these three things in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying the flesh, in building Cities for the glory of this world, and in leaving a name behinde, stands all <hi>Cains</hi> desire. But the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this name is in one of these two respects.</p>
               <p>First, If a man will see what is true dedication, let him look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the worldly minded man, for none doe so truly dedicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the true God, as they doe consecrate themselves to the World: It is indeed
<hi>sacra fames;</hi> for as Christ saith, <hi>The Children of this world are wiser in their generation, than the Children of light, Luke</hi> the sixteenth chapter. Therefore in them we may see the lively example of true dedication.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If not that, yet for as much as every dedication is the first act; for the first thing to be done when a new House is to be built, is to dedicate it by great feastings. This sheweth that as all the things of this life are but beginnings; for as Christ kept the best wine last,
<hi>John</hi> the second chapter, so the consummation of all things is in
<hi>Salem,</hi> which is Gods City: But <hi>Cains Enoch</hi> is nothing but fair shewes of joy and feastings, which shall end in mournings. Where it is said <hi>Cain</hi> was building a City, and not that he built it, it is to teach us that he did but begin it: we see the like in the worlds course, men are ever building and pulling down, they are never at rest, but continually in the Land of <hi>Nod: Nunquam aedificavêrunt,</hi> as the Preacher saith,
<hi>The soul still desireth, but is never satisfied, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastes</hi> the fifth chapter; even so <hi>Cain</hi> is alwayes occupied in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the City, but never makes an end; but even before he hath done he drops into the grave; like the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> the twelfth chapter, that suddenly while he was consulting how to build Barns, was taken away. These are <hi>Cains</hi> three waies; <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Prolis, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truxio Urbis, &amp; propagatio Nominis;</hi> the one <hi>is the lust of the flesh,</hi> the other <hi>the lust of the eyes,</hi> the third <hi>the pride of life, John</hi> the second chapter: And these are the waies of the world. All the desires of worldly men stand in these three; to have many Children, to build fair houses, and to get an honorable name among men. Thus far goeth worldly men, and no farther, as we see not only in <hi>Cain,</hi> but in
<hi>Nimrod,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> all whose studdy was in getting Children, in building Cities, and seeking to make their name famous. These are the men of this world, from whom the Prophet prayeth to be delivered, <hi>That have their portion in this life, their bellies are filled with hid treasure, their Children have enough, and leave the rest to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and this is all they seek for; but the Godly say with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Psalm</hi> the seventeenth and the fourteenth verse, <hi>But I will seek for thy presence in righteousness;</hi> that is <hi>Seths Enoch,</hi> and not <hi>Cains. We have not here</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>any abiding City, Hebrews</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter and the fourteenth verse; that is true, for albeit we have Cities, yet they continue not, <hi>therefore we seek for a City of Gods building, Hebrews</hi> the eleventh chapter and the ninth verse, and not a City built by <hi>Cain.</hi> This is a point of examination, for it is to be considered, whether a man in the course of his life reach any further
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:62585:265"/>than these three. If he goe no farther in the practise of his life, but to get Children, to build Cities and fair Houses, and to get a name, he is in the way of <hi>Cain:</hi> But if with the other <hi>Enoch</hi> we continue still in Gods presence, then we doe well: <hi>Cain</hi> having life granted for repentance, mispends it in building of a City, and such like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; And as there is a woe to him, so woe to them that like him mispend their time which God giveth them for repentance, <hi>Jude</hi> the eleventh verse. <hi>Cain</hi> is in a place of torment, where he cryeth, woe that he mispent his time so vainly, and therefore we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware by his example; for this is the use we are to make of <hi>Cain</hi> and the Reprobate, that when we see what is their end, we beware that we walk not in their waies, that we mispend not our time in fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the lusts of the flesh, and vanity of buildings, and seeking the glory and honor of this world, because to all such there belongs a woe no less than to <hi>Cain,</hi> as it is in the epistle of
<hi>Jude.</hi>

In the journey <hi>Moses</hi> begins to set down the Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Cain;</hi> and the end of that journey is the story of
<hi>Lameoh,</hi> wherein it may justly be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, First, why any mention is made in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Reprobate? Secondly, why it makes mention of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of <hi>Cain</hi> before the generation of <hi>Seth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first, It is a matter of absolute necessity, that the Scripture should make mention of the ungodly and reprobate; for whereas God proclaimed enmitie between the Serpents seed and the seed of the Woman,
<hi>Genesis</hi> the third chapter and the eleventh verse, it was his will that it should appear in the world, how the one was an enemie to the other; therefore it is called <hi>liber bellorum domini, Joshua</hi> the tenth chapter: The life of man is called <hi>militia super terram, Job</hi> the seventh chapter, and the Church is called the Church militant, &amp; <hi>haec est patientia Sanctorum, Revelations</hi> the fourteenth chapter and the twelfth verse, to shew that the godly have enemies in this world, whereby their patience is tried.</p>
               <p>Secondly, why mention is made first of the pedigree of
<hi>Cain,</hi> there is sufficient reason to be given; that is, In as much as the wicked are called <hi>the men of this world, Psalm</hi> the seventeenth,
<hi>and</hi>
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:62585:265"/>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the wicked, saith first,
<hi>Metthew</hi> the twenty fifth chapter, <hi>Venite bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicti patris mei;</hi> that is in regard of the persons, and for sinne it self, as the Philosopher saith, <hi>ad meminem ante venit mens bona quim ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus malus,</hi> every man is first possessed with an evill minde before he can have a good minde: as the Apostle saith, in the first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the the fifteenth chapter and the fourty fift verse, <hi>That is not first which is spirituall, but that which is naturall: We are all by nature first the Children of wrath, Ephesians</hi> the second chapter, and belong to the posterity of
<hi>Cain,</hi> before we can be partakers of grace; and therefore it is good reason that in Scripture our state by nature be first spoken of, before our state by grace; that the Law should goe before the Gospel; the seed of the Serpent before the blessed feed of the Woman.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It may be demanded why this passage is made to the story of <hi>Lamech,</hi> next after the story of <hi>Cain?</hi> the reason is, for that it is Gods will to bring sinne to a head: For as in <hi>Adam</hi> we saw the poyson of the Serpent, and the infection of it in <hi>Cain,</hi> so here is a new infection: <hi>For as there is a spirit that lusteth after envy, James</hi> the fourth chapter, which made <hi>Cain</hi> kill his brother; so in

                  <pb n="470" facs="tcp:62585:266"/>And in these two Reprobates, infected with these two kindes of temptations, the Holy Ghost sheweth the perfection of sinne: For sanctification hath two parts: First, That we possesse our vessels in holiness, which is an exposition to the uncleaness of <hi>Lamech,</hi> and in the first to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> the fourth chapter and the sixt verse, <hi>that no man oppresse or tread down his brother,</hi> which opposeth it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the spirit of <hi>Cain,</hi> who trod down his brother and violently slew him. Charity and chastity are a full comprehension of the duty of sanctification, which God willeth us to perform: And as <hi>Cains</hi> sinne stands first in the story, so it is first in nature; for a Child before he be able to speak one word, will by his sower face shew that he hath a revenging spirit. But in this story of <hi>Lamech</hi> we must observe a farther thing, for it standeth upon two parts: First in the ninteenth verse is shewed not only that he was infected with a spirit of uncleanness, but also verse the twenty third, a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and insolent spirit, which is a degree beyond <hi>Cain;</hi> for there he braggeth of his sinne, and contemneth God and his Judgments, as if he should not be revenged of him for it. For when a sinner is not only possessed and infected with malice and envy in his heart, and with lust in his reins, but braggs of his sin in contempt of God and his Judgments, then he is at the height of sinne: <hi>Peccator cum in profundum venerit contemnit.</hi> Thus where there are but three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the soul, all are corrupted by the infection of the Serpent: as for reason it was corrupted in <hi>Adam,</hi> when the Serpent perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him that he should be like God: and the angry part was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in <hi>Cain,</hi> when he was stirred up to kill his Brother without all cause. Thirdly, the will and the coveting part was corrupted in
<hi>Lamech,</hi> so as neither the bond of nature, nor the will of God, which is a spirituall bond, could keep in order; but he will shew his uncleanness. When not only <hi>Adam</hi> looseth faith, and <hi>Cain</hi> charity, but
<hi>Lamech</hi> chastity, then is sinne at the height. In the first verse there is a genealogie of four discents, wherein there is no matter of great edification: Howbeit as when mens Fields and Closes are laid out, all must not be taken up for pasture, but a little way must be left, whereby every man may pass to his own ground; so in the Scripture there must be a passage from one storie to another: And as in the body, for that there are a great many lymbs and parts, they must of necessity be compacted one with another by the help of the sinews; so both in prophane Writers and in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, many things are set down to shew the dependance that one story hath with another, which otherwise would not seem so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. Even so the shewing how <hi>Cain</hi> is joyned with <hi>Lamech,</hi> which is done in this verse, is very necessary. Secondly, There is a farther matter in this heaping of names, besides the continuance of the story: for it would have seemed strange that the Scripture doth make mention of <hi>Lamech</hi> and his wicked course, unless it were withall shewed from whence he came: But in setting down, that <hi>Lamech</hi> is of the posterity of wicked <hi>Cain,</hi> no man will marvell that
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:62585:266"/>he doe expresse the manners of <hi>Cains.</hi> Besides that, we may not think that this heaping of words is vain; for as the Fathers note, there is no name in Scripture without profitable consideration; for howsoever men that deal in woods and base mettals, care not to let chips and parings fall from them, yet as they that work in gold and Silver, will not lose the least parings: The like is to be done in reading the word, <hi>For it is pure as silver that hath been purified se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times, Psalm</hi> the twelfth,
<hi>More to be desired than gold, Psalm</hi> the ninteenth; therefore we must have this conceit of it, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever seemeth to be superfluous in the word of God, hath great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue both for faith and life: For <hi>Isidor</hi> saith,
<hi>est in nominibus sacris sua theologia,</hi> and as <hi>Jerome</hi> saith,
<hi>in nominibus sacrae Scripturae inscul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puntur mysteria:</hi> Therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>That the Sonne of God is more excellent than the Angels, in as much as he hath a more excellent name than they, Hebrews</hi> the first chapter and the fourth verse; so when the blinde man is sent to wash himself in
<hi>Shilo, John</hi> the ninth chapter and the seventh verse: The word signifying sent, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that he could not be purified by that water, unless he was sent; so in the names of holy Scripture, we see as <hi>Jerome</hi> saith, there are ingraven mysteries. Now we give names to our Children <hi>ad placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> but in the old Testament the Fathers gave names of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, with great advise; so we see <hi>Eve</hi> giveth a reason why she cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her Sonne <hi>Cain, Genesis</hi> the fourth chapter and the first verse, so is there a reason of <hi>Seths</hi> name, <hi>Genesis</hi> the fourth chapter and the twenty fift verse, of <hi>Noah</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Lamech, Genesis</hi> the fift chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the twenty ninth verse, of <hi>Isaack</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> and all the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches.</p>
               <p>The reason why they had this regard in giving of names, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to two. First, in those that are the Children of the godly, their names are a kinde of Prophesie, concerning the disposition of the Childe: which choice of names their Fathers made; for that being endued with the spirit of God, they foresaw the disposition of their Children. On the other side, the wicked and the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate cannot prophesie, yet their names are <hi>specula paternae affectionis,</hi> as the names of godly Children are prophesies
<hi>puerilis indolis.</hi> That it is thus in these names, we shall observe an encounter made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the seed of <hi>Cain</hi> and the seed of
<hi>Seth,</hi> which as they were of a contrary disposition, so gave their Children contrary names. <hi>Cain</hi> called his Sonne <hi>Enoch,</hi> that is, dedicated to the pleasure of the world; but <hi>Seths</hi> Sonne is called
<hi>Enosh,</hi> that is, sorrowfull, <hi>Genesis</hi> the fift chapter: On the one side there was <hi>Cain,</hi> on the other <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan: Irad</hi> on the one side, <hi>Jerad</hi> on the other: <hi>Methushael</hi> and
<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thushelah,</hi> by which names the seed and posterity of godly
<hi>Sheth</hi> shew a contrary affection, and such as differeth from the wicked and the seed of <hi>Cain,</hi> as appeareth by the signification of their names.</p>
               <p>Touching the opposition that appeares to be between the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Seth,</hi> and the posteritie of <hi>Cain: Enochs</hi> name who was<pb n="472" facs="tcp:62585:267"/>
                  <hi>Cains</hi> Sonne signifieth dedication, and there is one of the Children of God called by the same name, <hi>Genesis</hi> the fifth chapter and the ninteenth verse; but <hi>Seths Enoch,</hi> as
<hi>Jude</hi> saith, was the seventh from <hi>Adam;</hi> verse the fourteenth, that is, one dedicated to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth or Sabbath day, one that gave himself wholly to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and worship of God; but <hi>Cains Enoch</hi> was the first, and next to <hi>Cain,</hi> that is, one dedicated to the first day, which is a working day, to shew that he was one that gave himself to the affaires of this life, that sought to be mighty on earth: And this difference of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection holds to this day; for all men are followers either of the first or second <hi>Enoch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next of <hi>Cain</hi> is called <hi>Irad,</hi> that is, Lord of a City, the same that <hi>Herod</hi> signifieth, wherein we see his ambitious spirit, that he was such a one as sought to be great in the world. And as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> when he was not able to maintain the Kingdome which he had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped, began to meddle in Religion, and to set up two Calves, saying,
<hi>Behold your Gods,</hi> in the first of <hi>Kings</hi> the twelfth chapter; so <hi>Irad</hi> calls his Sonne <hi>Mehujael,</hi> First what thing is God; such a one as saith with <hi>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord? Exodus</hi> the fift chapter, that is, that cared not for God: And as <hi>Abraham</hi> when he came to <hi>Gerar,</hi> said, <hi>Surely forasmuch as the feare of God is not in this place, they will kill me, Genesis</hi> the twentieth chapter; so
<hi>Mehujael</hi> that cared not for God begets <hi>Methujhael,</hi> that is, a desparate fellow, that cares not for death; and his Sonne is <hi>Lamech,</hi> that is, a violent fellow, a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor and an oppressor, one that spoileth and treadeth down every man. On the other side, as <hi>Cain</hi> hath
<hi>Irad,</hi> one that would exalt himself to be Lord; so <hi>Seth</hi> hath
<hi>Jerad,</hi> one that is content to goe down; for <hi>Mehujael</hi> a contemner of God, among the Children of God there was <hi>Mahalaleel, id est, anuncians,</hi> or <hi>laudans deum,</hi> a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious person that would praise God: For <hi>Methushael,</hi> among the godly there was <hi>Methushelah,</hi> whose name tells us death is triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because it is the reward of sinne, and hath a worm that dieth not, and a fire that is never quenched: For
<hi>Lamech</hi> the wicked, he is the seventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> as
<hi>Enoch</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Seth;</hi> but this <hi>Enoch</hi> being the seventh, respects things that pertain to the seventh day, wherein
<hi>Lamech</hi> is given to oppression. This <hi>Enoch</hi> prophesied an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication against sinners that did wickedly &amp; spake proudly, saying,
<hi>The Lord commeth with thousands of his Saints to give judgement against them,</hi> as it is in the fourteenth verse of the epistle of <hi>Jude,</hi> and we shall not see any in the Scripture that spake so proudly as this
<hi>Lamech,</hi> for he not only brags of his sinne, but contemns Gods threatnings, and saith he will kill any that come to him; therefore this excommunication concerns him; for as <hi>Seths Enoch</hi> walked with God, so
<hi>Lamech</hi> that comes of <hi>Cain</hi> walked after the spirit of the world.</p>
               <p>In the story of <hi>Lamech</hi> there are two things to be observed, First, his overflowing lust: Secondly, his contempt of God, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment which God threatned. The excesse of his lust stands in
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:62585:267"/>this, that he took two Wives. Where we are to note that he is the first that durst vaunt of poligamie, he is <hi>primus sacrilegus nuptiarum,</hi> for in so doing, first he did violate the institution of God, which is, <hi>A man shall forsake Father and Mother and cleave
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> his Wife, Genesis</hi> the second chapter and the twenty fourth verse, not to his Wives, and they two shall be one flesh, not three in one flesh. Secondly, His taking of two Wives is a violating of humane custome, for he is in the seventh generation from
<hi>Adam; Adam</hi> had but one Wife, no more had <hi>Cain,</hi> nor the rest; but <hi>Lamech</hi> treading all custome under foot, takes two, wherein it is plain that a breach is made of the primitive custome; for as Christ saith,
<hi>Matthew</hi> the ninteenth chapter, <hi>non sic fuit abinitio.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Marriage is a mysterie, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> the fift chapter and the thirty second verse, for God commends unto us a sacred thing in marriage, that is the spirituall and holy conjunction of Christ with the Church. In which regard persons in that state should not exceed in lust, <hi>but possesse their Vessels in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> in the first to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> the fourth chapter, and the fourth and fift verses, <hi>and not in the lust of concupiscence.</hi> As <hi>Lamech</hi> sinneth against the institution of marriage in these three respects; so in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ends of the same, which are three, First, <hi>To be a remedy against fornication,</hi> in the first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the seventh chapter and the second verse, but
<hi>Lamechs</hi> two Wives were an allurement to it rather, and no remedy against it, for every man must have
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the first to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the seventh chapter and the third verse; therefore if he have Wives, it is an allurement to lust. Secondly, The end of marriage is propagation of Children, that there may be not only a seed, but <hi>semen sanctum, Malachie</hi> the second chapter: For that cause he made <hi>Adam</hi> but one Wife, whereas he had spirit enough, and might have made him more, but he sought a holy seed, therefore if any seek seed by more Wives, it is not a holy seed, but <hi>semen nequam, &amp; semen corruptem, Isaiah</hi> the first chapter. Thirdly, The end is for mutuall help, but to have more Wives at once, the one is a hindrance and no help; so were <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> to <hi>Jacob, Genesis</hi> the twenty ninth, so were <hi>Annah</hi> and
<hi>Peniah</hi> to <hi>Elkanah,</hi> in the first of <hi>Samuel</hi> the first chapter.</p>

<hi>Lamech:</hi> The former point verse the ninteenth, the latter in the three verses following.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Marriage of <hi>Lamech,</hi> we have already made an entrance into it, besides that which hath been already said. If we will know what to reckon of this second Wife which <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech</hi> took, the Holy Ghost doth set it out unto us in her name: For even in the names of holy Scripture, as we have heard, is engraven most excellent divinitic. His second Wifes name was <hi>Zillah,</hi> which hath relation to his first, for it signifies her shadow, but truth and shadowes are opposite; and therefore the Holy Ghost by this name tells us a second Wife is no true Wife, but a false, and that in such a marriage there is not the body and substance of Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, but only a shadow of it, as our Saviour Christ said to the Woman that had five Husbands,
<hi>John</hi> the fourth chapter and the eighteenth verse, <hi>He whom thou now hast is not thy Husband.</hi> And the sentence and judgment of the Hebrew Writers is, that where <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mechs</hi> former Wifes name is <hi>Adah,</hi> taken from a word that signifies an open assembly; and the second
<hi>Zillah,</hi> that is, a shadow or secret place; it is to teach us that
<hi>Lamech</hi> had his former Wife only for a shew, but he kept
<hi>Zillah</hi> in secret places, to satisfie his unclean lust privily.</p>
               <p>Now because we see this evill act of <hi>Lamech</hi> hath not so much as a good pretence, it is so much the worse; and that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a good pretence, we shall finde if we inquire what moved him to break out so farre contrary to the Ordinance of God, in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, who therefore created
<hi>Adam</hi> but one Wife, to teach him he might not have more at once. The only pretence for taking a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wife is the example of <hi>Abraham, Genesis</hi> the sixteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who for that he was without ofspring, was permitted by <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife to goe in to <hi>Agar,</hi> that of her he might raise up Children: but the case stood not so with <hi>Lamech,</hi> for he had by his first Wife two Sonnes, <hi>Jabal</hi> and <hi>Jubal,</hi> and therefore it was not for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing up of seed that he took
<hi>Zillah.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="475" facs="tcp:62585:268"/>Secondly, But if he say these were not enough, we shall see that the seed which he had by his false Wife, did not

                  </gap> and brass, that is, the first Warrier, and he that brought war into the world: So we see <hi>Lamechs</hi> purpose in taking a second Wife, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he desired to increase the world, yet by Gods just judgment turned to the destroying of mankinde, for he brought forth <hi>Tubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Cain,</hi> one that was a destroye.</p>
               <p>To this we add his Daughter whom he had by <hi>Zillah</hi> his unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Wife, whose name was <hi>Naamah,</hi> that is, fair, which being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the sixt chapter, we shall see that she was the overthrow of the world; <hi>For the sons of Seth saw the daughters of men that they were fair and beautifull,</hi> and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Familie of the godly, which caused the Lord to drown the world with a flood; so that as well the Daughters as the Sons that <hi>Lamech</hi> had by his unlawfull Wife, proved the overthrow of mankinde; and therefore it was no good pretence to marry a Second Wife to increase it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To proceed one step further in the choice of a second Wife, the example of <hi>David</hi> may be a good pretence, who seeing a virtuous woman <hi>Abigal,</hi>

<hi>Samuel</hi> the twenty ninth chapter; so that the good quality of the second Wife may somewhat abate the sinne. But <hi>Lamech</hi> took not
<hi>Zillah</hi> for any such respect of virtue: <hi>Zillah</hi> which is a shadow, betokens lightness and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>Jezebel,</hi> in the second of <hi>Kings,</hi> the ninth chapter and the third verse, <hi>Who for that she was not beautifull of her self naturally, painted her face. Adah,</hi> that is tireing and gorgeous apparell, is a mark of the Daughters of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when <hi>Deborah</hi> describes by their apparrell of divers colours, <hi>Judges</hi> the fift chapter and the thirtieth verse. <hi>Zil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,</hi> that is, lightness and wantonness, sets out unto us the strange woman, that is, an Harlots behaviour, <hi>Proverbs</hi> the seventh chapter and the tenth verse, and of a wanton pace, such as the Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes <hi>Isaiah</hi> the third chapter.

These things are enrolled by an honourable name, that is, the name of a Father, shewing plainly that they which bring forth actions that are profitable no less are to be counted Fathers, than they that bring forth Children, and that they ought accordingly to be honoured and reverenced as Fathers.</p>
               <p>The ancient Fathers make a question, Whether these men were the inventors of these things first? It is certain that <hi>Cain</hi> being an husbandman, had use of iron workes, as the Coulter and Share; and albeit he did invent iron tools fit for his purpose, yet that which is ascribed to
<hi>Tubal-Cain,</hi> was <hi>excultio &amp; expolitio,</hi> that is, the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of that work which <hi>Cain</hi> had begun. <hi>Abel</hi> was a shepheard, and could not but have use of tents, but yet the perfecting of that cunning in that kinde, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>Jubal. Mahalallel</hi> was one that used to praise God, as his name signifieth, which he could not doe without some kinde of musick; and therefore, in as much as he was farre ancienter than <hi>Lamech,</hi> it follows there was musick before <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> invented Instruments and Organs. This distinction therefore must be held in this point, which the School men make, that the one is <hi>quoad modum simplicis,</hi> the other <hi>quoad modum singularis.</hi> And therefore, in as much as <hi>Jabal-Jubal,</hi> and <hi>Tubal Cain</hi> are called Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of these arts, which were in use long before them, it is plaine, that not only the first inventors of any art are to be honoured, but even they also, that add any excellencie or perfection to any thing which they professe.</p>
               <p>To draw to an end: <hi>Lamech</hi> being thus blessed of God, in things naturall and pertaining to this life, ought to be thankfull to God.
<hi>Jacob</hi> when God gave him a sonne, called his name <hi>Judah,</hi> saying, <hi>I will praise the Lord, Genesis</hi> the twenty ninth chapter; but he is so farre from praising God, that he speakes hard things against God; (<hi>If Cain be avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy times seven fold.</hi>) And for men, he was so cruel against them, that he said no man should stirre against him, (<hi>He would kill a man in his rage.</hi>) Therefore he called his third sonne <hi>Tubal Cain,</hi> that is, another
<hi>Cain;</hi> as if he would have the name of <hi>Cain</hi> remembred, which God would have buryed. All these mercies moved not <hi>Lamech</hi> to any amendment, but as it is in the twenty sixth chapter of <hi>Isaiah, Let mercy be shewed to the wicked, yet will he doe wickedly;</hi> so did <hi>Lamech.</hi> And albeit these things which they invented, tended to the benefit of men, yet they were to their own destruction. <hi>Hypocrites can discern the face of the sky,</hi>

               <p>The beginning of worldly mens desire is <hi>Cain,</hi> that is the getting in of wealth; the end is <hi>Naomi,</hi> that is pleasure, and enjoying of it: that was the course of the covetous rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> the twelfth chapter, <hi>I will pull down Barns and set up bigger, and gather my corn thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and then say to my soul, thou hast enough, take thy pleasure;</hi> but as <hi>Naomi</hi> was turned into <hi>Mara,</hi> so this pleasure is turned into bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>Ruth</hi> the first chapter: The pleasure which worldly men enjoy here, is turned into the dreadfull torments of the world to come.</p>
               <p>On the other side, the generation of the godly begins with

                  <note place="margin">Januar. 20. 1599.</note>IN <hi>Lamech</hi> who was the seventh from <hi>Adam</hi> by the line of <hi>Cain,</hi> the Holy Ghost propounds the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a perfect wicked man; as in <hi>Enoch</hi> the seventh from <hi>Adam</hi> by the line of <hi>Seth,</hi> he sets out the pattern of a man perfectly righteous. Concerning <hi>Lamech,</hi> we heard his name is an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor; First of chastity, by violating Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, making three in one flesh, where God saith <hi>two shall be one flesh;</hi> and then of charity, by proclaiming to the world that no man should hurt him, but he should die for it: So that where there are two wayes that overthrow that excellent virtue of love and charity that joyns man to God, we see that
<hi>Lamech</hi> by turning love into fleshly lust, and charity into hatred and revenge, gives the world an example of both. In both he justifieth
<hi>Cain,</hi> as the Prophet, saith of <hi>Juda, That she justifieth Samaria and Sodom, because she excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them in their abominations, Ezekiel</hi> the sixteenth chapter and the fifty first verse; for <hi>Cain</hi> was content with one Wife, but <hi>Lamech</hi> gave the reins to lust, so as he took two; and though <hi>Cain</hi> murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Abel</hi> his brother, yet he adds not murther to murther as <hi>Lamech</hi> did, who saith. (<hi>That first he slew a man in his wound, and then a young man in his hurt,</hi>) but to these two he adds that which the Wise-man calls <hi>profundum malitiae,</hi> that is, contempt, <hi>Proverbs</hi> the eighteenth chapter and the third verse: For then is a man come to the depth of wickedness, when he contemnes God and his word; and this is it which the Sonne of God calls <hi>the depth of Satan, Revelations</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter &amp; the twenty fourth verse, for he scoffs at Gods words which he spake concerning <hi>Cain,</hi> verse the fifteenth, saying, <hi>(If Cain shall be avenged seven fold, truly Lamech seventy times seven fold,</hi> verse the twenty fourth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We doe not consider this by it self which
<hi>Lamech</hi> did, but we consider him as by this sinne he became the corrupter of mankinde; so as it may be said of him, that he made the whole world to sinne, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made Israel to sinne; for he was the first that brought in the sinne of uncleanness and cruelty, which are as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Psalm</hi> the eighteenth and the fift verse, <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes Belial,</hi> that is, the floods of wickedness which brought destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the old world, <hi>Genesis</hi> the sixt chapter: For as one saith, there was
<hi>priùs eluvio vitiorum</hi> before there was any deluge of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for so the Holy Ghost witnesseth, that the wickednesse of man
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:62585:271"/>was great upon earth, and the earth was filled with cruelty, and all flesh had corrupted his way; and all this proceeded from his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; for he gave the world a pattern to give the reins to lusts, and make no conscience of bloodshed, which brought destruction upon them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When as he had contrary to Gods Ordinance taken two Wives, <hi>Adah</hi> and <hi>Zillah,</hi> the one that set her felicity on pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of her face, like <hi>Jezabel,</hi> in the second of the
<hi>Kings</hi> the tenth chapter, the other to be to him as <hi>Herodias</hi> was to <hi>Herod, Matthew</hi> the fourteenth chapter. When God for all this spared <hi>Lamech,</hi> and did not punish him as he deserved, but rather blessed him with Children and earthly prosperity; yet he is not any thing the better for Gods mercy, but growes from one sinne to another, till his sin became as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Romans</hi> the seventh chapter, <hi>Out of measure sinfull,</hi> and till the chief sinne appear in him, which is even the head of the Serpent: In whom we finde that verified which the Preacher saith,
<hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> the eighth chapter and the eleventh verse, that if God presently punish any sinne, he is counted cruel, <hi>But when sentence against an evill work is not executed speedily, then the hearts of the children of men are fully set to doe evil:</hi> as the Apostle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sheweth, <hi>That whereas Gods patience and long-suffering should lead us to repentance, the wicked abuse his goodness, and take occasion thereby to add sinne to sinne, and so to heap up wrath for themselves against the day of wrath, Romans</hi> the second chapter and the fourth and fist verses. The discovering of these sinnes is plainly opened in this oration which <hi>Lamech</hi> makes to his Wives; for sinne discloseth it self two wayes, either by <hi>Cains</hi> way, that is, by the eye or countenance; as <hi>Cain</hi> when his heart grew malicious, shewed it presently in his countenance, verse the fifteenth, or else <hi>Lamechs</hi> way, that is, by the some or froth of the mouth; for we see here according to Christs rule, <hi>Matthew</hi> the twelfth chapter, <hi>That Lamechs mouth speaketh from the abundance of his heart, for the tongue is the Trumpet of the minde; and as a Galilean may be known by his speech, Matthew</hi> the twenty sixt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so by a mans talk it will appear how his heart is affected. His speech consists first of a preface (<hi>Heare my voice ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my words.</hi>) Secondly, the body of his oration, <hi>(I have killed</hi> [or will kill] <hi>a man in my wound, and a young man in my hurt.)</hi> Thirdly, <hi>If Cain shall be avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy times seven times.</hi> In which words he saith in effect, that he will neither doe right not suffer wrong.</p>
               <p>His Preface we see is a solemn and grave Speech, as if
<hi>Solomon</hi> himself were delivering some great piece of wisedome, or as if some Prophet were to declare some weighty matter in the name of the Lord. That we may see, that the wicked are as carefull in stirring up the hearers to hear their blasphemies, as the Prophets and Saints of God are to crave attention to their heavenly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>They are like the words of <hi>Jacob</hi> to his Children,
<hi>Genesis</hi> the<pb n="482" facs="tcp:62585:272"/>fourty ninth chapter and the second verse, <hi>Hear ye Sonnes of Jacob, hearken to Israel your Father:</hi> where, to hearken is more than to hear, and the speech is more than the voice; whereby
<hi>Lamech</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his Wives with all attention to bow their eares to that which he saith; which sheweth that he imagined that which he spoke was some great matter, whereas indeed it is nothing but a vain boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of his power, that he can doe mischief, <hi>Psalm</hi> the fifty second, for the Prophet saith, <hi>That the great men speak out the corruption of their hearts, and they wrap it up, Micah</hi> the seventh chapter and the third verse; and so doth this great Gyant <hi>Lamech:</hi> we see by his words he hath this opinion, that he ought to be heard being a man of this power. For as the Wise-man saith of the practise of the world, If the rich man speaks, all must hearken to his word, but the poor when he speaks cannot be heard: but see what is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his speech for all his good preface; therefore we must not presently impute wisedome to every one that beginneth in this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner.</p>
               <p>Of the body of his Oration be two parts, First a proclaiming to the world <hi>What he will doe if he be touched,</hi> Secondly, <hi>If Cain be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged seven times, then Lamech seventy times seven fold.</hi> Of the former there are two readings; the one is, <hi>I have stain a man being but woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and killed a young man in my hurt.</hi> The latter is, <hi>I would kill a man.</hi> If it be the former, it is a Commemoration; If the latter a Commination, wherein he breatheth forth threatnings, as <hi>Saul</hi> did
<hi>Acts</hi> the eighth chapter, against any that should doe him wrong: The one is a bragging of his strength, that he feels himself so strong, as if he were wounded, yet he is able to be avenged of him that shall touch him: The other shewes his vindicative spirit, that is so far from suffering, that if he be but touched, he will kill: he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens <hi>pro vulnere mortem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the first, by that which the Apostle saith, in the second to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the tenth chapter, <hi>That if God give strength and power to any man, it is not to destroy, but to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> We see it is no true boasting which <hi>Lamech</hi> makes, he doth not boast aright that saith, he is of strength to doe hurt: the commendation of strength is not in killing and wounding, but in saving and defence.</p>
               <p>For the second interpretation we are to know it is no just dealing, to kill him that hath but inflicted a wound; for justice is, there should be <hi>talio,</hi> wound for wound, and not death for a wound. If it be read as the Fathers read it (<hi>I have killed a man in my wound</hi>) then it is a confession. Now we know confessions proceed of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but that was not the cause of <hi>Lamechs</hi> confession, for then he would not have chosen these confessions, but it is in the spirit of arrogancie that he confesseth to his wives what he hath done: He saith that when he had killed one man in his wound, then he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to kill a young man, that is, he added blood to blood. It is enough for a man to sinne, though he doe not brag of it, but when they doe as the Sodomites did, that is, <hi>praedicare peccata sua, Isaiah</hi>
                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:62585:272"/>the third chapter and the ninth verse; then they are come to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of wickedness, if they brag of their sinne, and are so far from sorrowing for their finne, that they seek applause for it, as if they had done well. This preaching of sinne, and that rejoying in wickedness, which the Wise-man speaks of, <hi>Proverbs</hi> the second chapter and the fourteenth verse, <hi>exultat in rebus
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Naturally men are ashamed of sinne, and it is a signe of grace so to be affected; therefore the Lord saith, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the eighth chapter and the twelfth verse, <hi>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?</hi> but where instead of covering their faces with shame for sinne, <hi>Men have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>Samuel</hi> the twenty fift chapter, which they conceive that they have offended God; but when instead of sorrow and shame, there is an exaltation, or rejoycing, of the evill they have done, and a hardness of heart, so as they cannot be touched with any grief of their

<hi>Why dost thou preach my law, and take my covenant in thy mouth?</hi> so it may be said, what should <hi>Lamech</hi> doe with Gods words in his mouth? if he did call them to minde to the end they might convert him, it were well, but he perverts the words of God, and scoffs at them. (<hi>If Cain be avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy times se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times</hi>). Wherein first he saith he will be revenged; Secondly he argues, if <hi>Cain,</hi> then much more he; Thirdly, he goeth further, and because some might say to him, why? you may be killed your self, you are but a man; therefore he answers, let him kill me that will, he that kills me shall be avenged seventy times. <hi>If Cain shall be avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy times seven times,</hi> as if he should say, now is the seventh generation ended. Though <hi>Cains</hi> posterity be most prophane, yet it doth as well as <hi>Seths,</hi> for we are Great Grasiers of Cattel, we have Instruments of musick; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which God said of <hi>Cains</hi> punishment (<hi>If thou doe evill sinne lyeth at the dore</hi>) is nothing so; <hi>Lamech</hi> doth, like an Infidel, say, all that God saith is nothing.</p>
               <p>But if we yet look more narrowly into this speech of
<hi>Lamech,</hi> there is a further thing in it; for if he argues thus, (<hi>if Cain be avenged seven times, then Lamech much more</hi>) What is his ground to make this conclusion? Surely this wicked perswasion, That the more a man sinneth, the more he shall be respected of God: for <hi>Lamech</hi> was the greater sinner; <hi>Cain</hi> contented himself with one wife, but
<hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech</hi> took a second; <hi>Cain</hi> killed but one, but
<hi>Lamech</hi> first killed one, after he killed another, and therein justifieth <hi>Cain</hi> as an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, in respect of himself: <hi>Cains</hi> offence was <hi>sub lege occultâ,</hi> he heard no more, <hi>But that if thou doe evill sinne lyeth at the dore,</hi> but <hi>Lamechs</hi> sinne is
<hi>sub lege manifestâ,</hi> for he seeth an example of Gods punishment upon <hi>Cain</hi> for his murther; therefore seeing <hi>Lamech</hi> is the greater Offender, and seeing <hi>pro mensura peccati erit &amp; plagarum modus, Deuteronomie</hi> the twenty fift chapter; it stands not in reason, that if
<hi>Cain</hi> being a lesser sinner, be avenged seven times, that
<hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech</hi> being a greater offender, shall be avenged seventy times seven times; therefore this is open blasphemie against the justice of God, who, as the sin is greater, so inflicts a greater punishment. He reasons thus, seeing God will avenge a murtherer it is a signe he loves them, therefore he will love me; for <hi>Cain</hi> was but a young murtherer, he killed but one; but I am an ancient practiser of this sinne, I have killed two; therefore he will see that I shall be much more avenged; as if he should say, the more sinner a man is, the more he shall be favoured of God. That is his reasoning.</p>
               <p>One step further we are yet to arise in the consideration of his argument; for thus he saith, God hath prophesied concerning <hi>Cain,</hi> that he that killeth shall be avenged seven times; and I will prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie concerning my self, if any kill me, he leaves not vengeance to <pb n="485" facs="tcp:62585:273"/>God, but chooseth vengeance for himself: <hi>Cains</hi> seven times will not serve him, but he must be avenged seventy times more.</p>
               <p>If we lay these things together, that is, his vain boasting and his threatning, with the irreligious and most wicked consequence that he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that if God respect
<hi>Cain</hi> a sinner, he will much more respect him, because he is a greater sinner: This will shew that <hi>Lamech</hi> is not only past shame, but without all fear: he is so farr from shame and grieving for his sinne, that he brags of it. If this be not the Serpents head, and the chief sinne that can be; that is the breathing out of blasphemies against God, and threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst man, I know not what is. It we compare <hi>Lamech,</hi> the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents seed, with Christ the seed of the woman, we shall see that he being asked of <hi>Peter, how oft he should forgive his brother, Matthew</hi> the eighteenth chapter, useth the same stiles concerning mercy and forgiveness, which <hi>Lamech</hi> useth touching revenge, that is, <hi>to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give till seventy times seven times:</hi> whereby he teacheth <hi>Peter</hi> to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply forgiveness, because he himself shall need to have many sinnes forgiven him, to teach us that in shewing mercy, we must follow the rule which the wicked keep in revenge. We see Christs testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the shedding of blood, that he will have mercy shewed, but <hi>Lamech</hi> will have revenge extended to seventy times seven times, whereas Christ will have mercy extended: The one is the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of charity, the other the restorer; therefore we must hearken to him; we see what became of <hi>Lamech</hi> and his posterity. <hi>Job</hi> saith of them, that as the floods of wickednesse went over their soul, so it brought upon them a flood of water, whereby the whole world was drowned, and then those mighty Gyants <hi>gemebant sub aquis.</hi>

And<pb n="488" facs="tcp:62585:275"/>this is a means to make a man think of such an estate, <hi>Wherein he may have that pleasure and joy, which shall not be taken from him,</hi> as Christ speaketh, <hi>John</hi> the sixteenth chapter and the twenty second verse. Now when <hi>Adam</hi> had relieved himself with this cogitation, that as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Psalm</hi> the eighty ninth,
<hi>God hath not made all men for nought,</hi> it made him to return; whereupon there followed by Gods blessing, not only a seed, but a chosen and holy seed, that is <hi>Seth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning whom, first we will speak of his birth, wherein we have this to observe, that those Children whom God gives to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents upon a plentifull contrition and repentance, doe usually prove men excellent in all spirituall graces. The first example hereof is <hi>Seth,</hi> who is not only the foundation of the Church, but of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde; for since the flood all the Sons of men are called the Children of <hi>Seth.</hi> It is also shewed in
<hi>Joseph,</hi> whom God gave to <hi>Rachel,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving opened her wombe which before was shut up, so as she was barren, <hi>Genesis</hi> the thirtieth chapter, and the twenty second verse: It also appeared in <hi>Hannah,</hi> who having bewailed her own case in the bitterness of her soul, received from the Lord a blessed seed, that was <hi>Samuel,</hi> who restored religion, and setled the state of the Kingdome, in the first of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the first chapter, and the sixteenth verse; but it is most plain in the birth of
<hi>Solomon;</hi> for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Davids</hi> great fall, and the grievous punishment that God laid upon him, upon his great repentance, which followed, whereof, the fifty first <hi>Psalm,</hi> is a perpetuall monument, God gave him a Sonne, that was <hi>Solomon,</hi> the like whereof was never before, nor hath been since, in the second of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the twelfth chapter. As on the other side, they that are born according to the flesh, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in the strength of nature, prove wilde and rebellious, as Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael and
<hi>Absolom,</hi> and of a contrary disposition to them that are born to them that are in the state of grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For his name, and that little Sermon which
<hi>Eve</hi> makes touching his name, that is, she called him <hi>Seth,</hi> and renders a reason, <hi>quia posuit eum

               <p>In which Sermon there is no one word, which hath not its seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sense. It is said, First, He is <hi>positus.</hi> Secondly, By God. Thirdly, As a seed.

               <p>For the term of putting or setting, we have it in the third chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and the fifteenth verse; where God saith, <hi>I will put enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Psalm</hi> the hundred fourty eighth, <hi>He sets them a law; Proverbs</hi> the twenty second chapter and the twenty eighth verse, <hi>Remove not the ancient bounds which thy Fathers have set;</hi> in the first epistle of

<hi>Nod:</hi> To teach us, That in the felicity of Gods Saints, there is stedinesse and continuance; but as for the pleasures of the wicked, they continue not one hour, but are uncertain. So that it is in effect as if God should say, before indeed I gave <hi>Abel,</hi> but it was not my minde to have him continue; but this seed, whom I will give <hi>Adam,</hi> shall stay, so as neither <hi>Cain,</hi> nor <hi>Lamech, nor the gates of hell shall prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, Matthew</hi> the sixteenth chapter: That is the meaning of the word (<hi>set</hi> or <hi>put</hi>) which was the first observation.</p>
               <p>And this seting or putting receives great strength from the setter, that is God; whole weaknesse is stronger than the strength of man: And therefore look what he sets shall continue; to teach us, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the first Saint was taken away, yet now he will have Saints to continue: They shall not only be shewed to the world, but shall have a foundation, and take root, being set by God.</p>
               <p>Touching the wicked, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> saith, <hi>Their foundation is as an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of water,</hi> for they shall be carried away, as <hi>Cains</hi> posterity was, <hi>with a flood, Job</hi> the twenty second chapter, and the sixteenth verse: But the righteous shall have an everlasting foundation, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> the tenth chapter: For as when God will have a thing croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, no man can it make streight, <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> the seventh chapter and the fifteenth verse; so what God will

               <p>On the other side, Whom Christ taketh to his custody, he saith of them, in the tenth chapter of St. <hi>John, No man shall take them out of mine hand;</hi> and as the Apostle saith, in the second to <hi>

                  </gap> of the godly, to continue in the world, till he come to call them out of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is said of <hi>Seth</hi> he is <hi>positus in semen,</hi> for there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that is no seed, that was <hi>Abel;</hi> before God gave a man to <hi>Adam,</hi> but he gave no seed to him; for that is called seed of which there growes something: But of <hi>Abel</hi> there came no
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> or seed

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; but as it is said of Christ, that when he shall lay down his life, <hi>videbit semen longaevum, Isaiah</hi> the fifty third chapter, that is a seed, though not issuing out of his loyns, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from his spirit.
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:62585:276"/>So we are to understand that spiritually there came a seed of <hi>Abel,</hi> for there is a spirituall generation as well as a carnall; so spiritually <hi>Elisha</hi> was the Childe of <hi>Elias,</hi> because the spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> was dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled upon him, in the second of
<hi>Kings,</hi> the second chapter; and <hi>John</hi> Baptist is called
<hi>Elias, Matthew</hi> the seventeenth chapter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in these graces of the spirit that was in <hi>Elias,</hi> he resembled him, as the Child doth the Father. It is the saying of the Prophet, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the sixt chapter,
<hi>semen sanctum est substantia mundi,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Seth</hi> is appointed and set by God to be the spirituall seed of the Church, as the seed of mankinde by carnall generation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, But why should God need to give <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve</hi> seed, he had seed enough already, that was <hi>Cain</hi> and his posterity, which were come to seventy seven persons, yea, but they are not content with that seed, but would have another. <hi>Cains</hi> seed pleaseth them not, therefore they are earnest Suters to God, for a holy seed. As God promised <hi>Abraham</hi> first a seed that should be <hi>sicut pulvis terrae, Genesis</hi> the thirteenth chapter and the sixteenth verse, that is such as should grow in the earth, and set their affections therein; and after another that should be <hi>sicut stellae coeli, Genesis</hi> the eighteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is such a seed as should set their mindes in heaven, and seek for a heavenly country, <hi>Hebrews</hi> the eleventh chapter; So <hi>Adams</hi> two seeds, first <hi>Cain</hi> and his posterity, which were like the dust of the earth, such as were earthly affected; and therefore they would have another seed like the starres of heaven, such as should have their conversation in heaven; it is that which the Prophet tells us, there is <hi>semen nequam, Isaiah</hi> the first chapter, that is, a naughty and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt seed, such was the seed of <hi>Cain:</hi> and there is <hi>semen sanctum, Isaiah</hi> the sixt chapter, such a seed was it that <hi>Adam</hi> desired: <hi>Cain</hi> was a naughty seed, but they would have a holy seed; for there is not only good seed, but tares as Christ sheweth, <hi>Matthew</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter. Such is the difference that is in seeds: A holy seed is such as shall sinne, but yet shall not doe sinne, in the first epistle of <hi>John</hi> the third chapter, that is not <hi>operarius iniquitatis, Matthew</hi> the seventh chapter, because the seed of God is in them; but they that sell themselves to all manner of sinne, are the corrupt seed, such as power out themselves to all wickedness, because they have not the seed of God in them, but the Serpents seed, of whom it may be said, <hi>verò ex patre Diabilo estis, John</hi> the eighth chapter.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, This other seed might be another seed, yet not like
<hi>Abel,</hi> that is a seed more civill and temperate in the course of this life than <hi>Cain</hi> was, and his posterity, but they desire a seed for
<hi>Abel,</hi> that is, such another seed as <hi>Abel</hi> was: They desire a Child not simply, but <hi>pro Abele,</hi> that is, such a Child in whom they may finde the spirit of <hi>Abel,</hi> that they might say here is another
<hi>Abel,</hi> that though <hi>Abel</hi> be taken off, yet there might another like <hi>Abel</hi> be ingraffed.</p>
               <p>The last point is in these words, For <hi>Abel</hi> (whom
<hi>Cain</hi>

                  </gap>) There were many things that <hi>Cain</hi> could endure well enough in<pb n="491" facs="tcp:62585:276"/>
                  <hi>Abel,</hi> but the cause why he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> him, was, for that he had a desire to please God, and to sacrifice to him in the best

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

<hi>Seth</hi> matches, so doe <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Enosh.</hi> On the behalf of <hi>Seth,</hi> we say that <hi>Moses</hi> having laid a foundation which was
<hi>(posuit deus,)</hi> in this verse he adds roof: for invocation is not made till the Temple be finished: and so in these two verses he comprehends the state of the Church. In the first, is the promise of God; in the second, the name of God. In which two is contained the duty of the whole worship of God. On the other side, that there might be a counterpoise and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position between the contrary parties; as <hi>Seth</hi> is opposed to <hi>Cain,</hi> so
<hi>Enosh</hi> stands against <hi>Enoch.</hi> For as we see there was a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty built on the one side, so on the other side there must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing built for the defence of the seed of the Godly: There must be some fence for
<hi>Seth</hi> and his seed, as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> had theirs:
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:62585:277"/>Therefore here is that which is called <hi>turris fortissima, Proverbs</hi> the eighteenth chapter, that is <hi>nomen domini,</hi> and it stands in opposition not only against him, but against all the rest, to counterpoise <hi>Jabal, Jubal,</hi> and <hi>Tubal Cain.</hi> First, against the wealth that <hi>Jabal</hi> brought in here, is the fear of the Lord, as <hi>Abraham, Genesis</hi> the twentieth chapter, whereof the Prophet saith, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the thirty third chapter and the sixt verse,
<hi>Timor Domini the saurus.</hi> Secondly, Against the pleasures and delights of <hi>Jubals</hi> invention of musick, we have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleasure in the Psalmes, <hi>Psalm</hi> the sixty third, <hi>My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyfull lips.</hi> Thirdly, Against the strength and power of <hi>Tubal Cain</hi> that deviseth weapons for warr, we have another kinde of armor, <hi>Psalm</hi> the twentieth,
<hi>Illi in curribus &amp; in equis, nos autem in nomine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini dei nostri invocabimus:</hi> So we see that which is ascribed to <hi>Enosh,</hi> doth answer not only <hi>Enoch,</hi> but all the rest. As on the one side in respect of <hi>Seth,</hi> when we read that God gave him a seed, we shewed that it was a holy seed, that he was the first that called on the name of the Lord: so on the other side in respect of <hi>Enosh</hi> and <hi>Enoch;</hi> as we see a City, so a Church; as in <hi>Enoch</hi> a state civill, so in <hi>Enosh</hi> a state ecclesiasticall; as there we had a company of men that placed their vocation in things of this life, so here we have another company, whose vocation is an invocation, that is, to adore and call upon the name of the Lord. As if <hi>Moses</hi> should say by way of apologie, that they were not a seed alone, but there is another seed; and as <hi>Cains</hi> posterity boasted themselves in earthly matters, so <hi>Seths</hi> seed was imployed in the service of God, which <hi>Moses</hi> opposeth against <hi>Enoch</hi> and the rest: For when, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaks, there is more spent in the making of Mattocks and Swords, that is a state civill; but when more time and pains is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed in the safegard and protection of the Church, than upon Lawyers: and that shewes a state ecclesiasticall. This shall suffice for the dependance of this verse.</p>
               <p>I come to the verse it self consisting of two parts: First, the birth and name of <hi>Enosh,</hi> Secondly, the invocation of the name of the Lord. First, the name <hi>Enosh</hi> signifies, a man, according to the four words in the holy tongue, and it gives us to understand thus much, that the conceipt of the Holy Ghost is, that that party that hath sense of God and his worship, and of spirituall things, as the invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the name of God, is to be called a man, otherwise he is like a beast, <hi>Psalm</hi> the fourty ninth, and no man; for that the God of heaven should receive no more honour and service from men than from bruit beasts, it is too unreasonable, seeing God hath endued man with reason; and therefore that which offereth it self here is, that <hi>Enosh</hi> from his invocation of the name of the Lord, took his manhood, that thereby it appeared that he was a man, and not a bruit beast: But as he signifies a man, so not every man; but as <hi>Adam</hi> is a person taken out of the molde of the earth, so <hi>Enosh</hi> is a<pb n="494" facs="tcp:62585:278"/>name pertaining to humility, and signifies a person that is lowly: The one was
<hi>manipulus terrae,</hi> the other <hi>cumulus miseriae,</hi> so that there is a name from the molde, whereof man is made, and into which he is cast, the consideration whereof is able to take down our pride; or if not that of
<hi>Adam:</hi> The other name <hi>Enosh,</hi> whereby we see that this man, that is made of the molde of the earth, is subject to so many miseries, sicknesses, sorrowes, and calamities.</p>
               <p>For the occasion of this name giving, there was a kinde of emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between the one side and the other; as on the one side, the one called his Sonne <hi>Enoch,</hi> so the other <hi>Enosh;</hi> the one
<hi>Irad,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jerad;</hi> the one <hi>Mehujael,</hi> the other
<hi>Methushael,</hi> which was done in this respect, to shew that another manner of contemplation occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies the heads of the Children of God, then the terrestriall dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the seed of the wicked: But especially this was done in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Prophesie, to shew how <hi>Seth</hi> did see that the Serpent slept not, but was hewing out a crosse and calamities for the Godly, and that <hi>Enoch</hi> had built a City and walls against the Church, and
<hi>Tubal-Cain</hi> had invented weapons of warr, and prepared armor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Seth.</hi> Therefore as <hi>Genesis</hi> the tenth chapter and the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fift verse, <hi>Eber</hi> calls his Sonnes name <hi>Peleg,</hi> because the division of the earth was in his dayes; so here <hi>Seths</hi> Son is called
<hi>Enosh,</hi> in respect of the crosses and tribulations that the Sonnes of men are subject unto; and that is one mysterie that the Fathers make of this place, that none should imagine <hi>Seth</hi> to be without his <hi>Enosh,</hi> that upon the godly the surges of the Sea shall arise, but not overwhelm them;
<hi>and that the gates of hell shall not prevail against them, Matthew</hi> the sixteenth chapter, but that he that grounds himself upon the worship of God by true invocation, shall be immoveable, and yet not without persecutions. And that is the first point, that to <hi>Seth</hi> is born <hi>Enosh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reason why God sends crosses and afflictions to men, is to try them, whether they be <hi>rooted and grounded in faith, Colossians</hi> the second chapter and the twenty seventh verse; and as in the first to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the eleventh chapter and the ninteenth verse, <hi>He suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers heresies, that they which are approved may be known;</hi> as also, because if men were not sometime perplexed, and prest down with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so as neither reason can releive them, nor the hand of flesh able to deliver them, when they cannot help themselves, but as past hope of remedy, they may ascribe their deliverance to God, and not to their own counsels or force.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it hangs well together, that this exercise of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation and prayer should arise from <hi>Enosh,</hi> for, <hi>James</hi> the fift chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the thirteenth verse, <hi>If any be afflicted let him pray;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such prayer is called <hi>oratio afflicti, Psalm</hi> the hundred and second and the seventeenth verse. As <hi>Abel's</hi> oblation belongs to the dayes of peace and prosperity; so <hi>Enosh's</hi> invocation belongs to the dayes of affliction and misery. when a man is strong to resist, and full of<pb n="495" facs="tcp:62585:278"/>vitall heat and spirit, then he cannot skill of invocation; but let God make him <hi>Enosh,</hi> and then he will <hi>begin to call upon the name of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In respect that it shewes what manner of Preacher it should be, that is, he must be one of the sons of <hi>Seth,</hi> that is, one of the Church; for <hi>the prayer of a faithfull man availeth much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also it must be <hi>Enosh's</hi> prayer, that is, of one that is humble, as the Publicans prayer, <hi>Luke</hi> the eighteenth chapter; so that the name of <hi>Enosh,</hi> in respect of <hi>Seth,</hi> shewes, that Christ shall not be without his Crosse, nor Christs Church without theirs.</p>
               <p>And in respect of himself it shewes, what shall be the afflictions of those that shall be thus called.</p>
               <p>Touching his Invocation, It is the title that it pleaseth the Holy Ghost to set out <hi>Enosh</hi> by, and it is an excellent title,

                  <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> that
<hi>Enosh</hi> should be the first that called upon the Name of the Lord: It was more honorable to him, than to wear any gorgeous apparrell, or Jewels whatsoever.</p>
               <p>In this part are two things: The nature of Invocation, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, set down in these words <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>First for the nature of Invocation; <hi>Invocare
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> vocare Deum, in se,</hi> or
<hi>ex se;</hi> and it is a speciall point: Many would have God about them, or near them, but not in them; for then they must look to govern their actions well.</p>
               <p>When men lay seige to a Town, they doe not think it sufficient to have them without, but they desire to get them within: Such an affection is required of them, say the ancient Writers, that will truly call upon God. For the manner, we must say with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, in the first epistle of
<hi>John,</hi> the fourth chapter and the fourth verse, <hi>Major est qui intus quàm qui extrà.</hi> Now for the Name of God; It is no unreasonable thing that we should call upon the name of those which we never saw; for as we know, those that dwell in the west &amp; northward parts, they believe &amp; obey the word and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> such a Princesse there is, therefore they receive the word as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of the mouth of the Princesse her self, and obey <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> So we see what Invocation is, and that the name of God is

               <p>Now to put a difference between these three, First, to call upon God; Secondly, upon the name of God; Thirdly, in the name of God. We say to call upon God is an expressing or

<hi>Psalm</hi> 77. and the 1. verse, <hi>I will crie to God with my voyce,</hi> and in the one hundred and six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth <hi>Psalm,</hi> and the fourth verse,
<hi>I will call upon the name of the Lord, saying, Lord I beseech thee deliver my soul:</hi> So that <hi>Moses</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is to shew, that not only an internall calling upon the name of God by desires, but that then there began an externall and vocall serving of God, with a profession of religion. Now to invocate in the name, is one thing, and to invocate upon the name of God, is another; the one is the party that is called upon, the other
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> out the party in whose name he is called upon, which shewes the persons distinct in the deitie, as our Saviour expounds it, in the sixteenth chapter of <hi>John,</hi> and the twenty third verse, <hi>Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you:</hi> There is both God the Father that is called upon, and Christ the Sonne, in whose name we pray. That is the difference between the two names, that is, they put not their trust in their own names, or in the arme of flesh, or in any other humane name, but in God; and not only invocate God, but they invocate him <hi>in nomine,</hi> that is in the name of another, <hi>And there is no other name given by which we shall be saved, but the name of Jesus, Acts</hi> the fourth chapter and the twelfth verse; and as in the first to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the third chapter and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth verse, <hi>Other foundation then that can no man lay.</hi> Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we have in this verse,
<hi>in nomine Dei,</hi> and <hi>semen aliud,</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer he shewes plainly what he means by <hi>posuit deus semen aliud, viz.</hi> that there is a person that shall be our seed, in whose name we are to trust, and invocate God: so that in these verses the mysterie of Christs incarnation is plainly expressed to those that shall well look into it.</p>
               <p>Now it is plain when he speaks of invocation, he means not pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er only, but by a part he expresseth the whole, which is by a Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche, as in the second chapter of <hi>Joel</hi> and the twenty third verse, <hi>Every one that calls upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved,</hi> which is repeated by the Apostle, <hi>Romans</hi> the tenth chapter and the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse; but you must mark what he saith after, <hi>How shall they call upon him, in whom they have not beleeved?</hi> there is faith required: Then he goes a step farther, <hi>How shall they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard?</hi> as if he should say it is impossible; therefore hearing is necessary: <hi>And how shall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> there is the office of preaching: <hi>And how shall they preach unless they be sent?</hi> there is the authority of ecclesiasticall power. We see what duties the Apostle raiseth from invocation, and consequently we must know, that when they began to call upon Gods name, then also<pb n="497" facs="tcp:62585:279"/>they began to beleeve in him: For albeit prayer is the more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall part of invocation, as a crying unto God, as the Fathers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve from the signification of the word; the exercise of prayse and thanksgiving is more effectuall to that purpose. But we add also as a speciall part of invocation, the blessing of the people, which, in the sixt chapter of <hi>Numbers</hi> and the twenty seventh verse, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>A putting of the name of God upon the people;</hi> so say we also of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian vowes and oathes, that the due regard had to the testifying of a truth, when a man doth call on the name of God, and deliver that which is true; that is also a service of invocation, whereby we confesse God able to punish us as a Judge if we swear not truly: Therefore invocation is of a farre larger compasse than an ordinary man would imagine, but especially when we consider it not only in generall, but in particular, when it is in the prime: For if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation be commanded at the time of publique prayer, much more is prayer and invocation commanded at the sacrifice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have an example in
<hi>Abraham, who built an Altar and called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the name of the Lord, Genesis</hi> the twelfth chapter and the eighth verse, and <hi>Psalm</hi> the one hundred and sixteenth, and the thirteenth verse, <hi>Calicem
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Touching the beginning of it, that is not without a scruple; for we may ask this question, if invocation were not before? and whether
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> did not call upon God? They did no doubt: But as I told you when I handled verse the twentieth, that <hi>Jabal</hi> was the Father of such as dwell in Tents, and have

<hi>invocatio templi,</hi> as well as <hi>invocatie coetûs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again we say there was an invocation before, that is, they prayed as the spirit moved them, but a formall invocation with Rites and Ceremonies, set down after a speciall manner, which we call the Lyturgie or publique service that began with <hi>Enosh:</hi> then began to appear the face of a Church. If you ask why this was not done before? you shall see it could not; for there being but <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> and then
<hi>Abel</hi> being slain, <hi>Adam</hi> was alone, and they that must be the lower part of the Church, must be two or three at least. Then it must begin in the Family of <hi>Seth,</hi> for it is impossible that this could be till there came a third person, which was <hi>Enosh:</hi> And then it pleased God to reveal this manner of invocation: For we know the Church consists of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to govern, parties to teach, and parres to receive direction. To govern and teach are two things, but performed now by one: then they began to call upon the name of the Lord: that was a thing agreeable to naturall sense, but before this time it was not so exquisitly done; and which is a thing memorable, they did this in the midst of a naughty and crooked Nation, <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> the second chapter and the fifteenth verse; for now they durst openly professe a publique service of God and invocate his name, notwithstanding the wicked seed, and especially when they see <hi>Abel</hi> come to an untimely end, that because he called upon God, therefore he suffered marryrdome. Besides that, albeit <hi>Enoch</hi> built a City, and <hi>Tubal-Cain</hi> invented armor, yet they will follow <hi>Abel,</hi> and professe themselves <hi>Seths</hi> Children; this shews they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a heroicall spirit, and had this conceit in the name of God, that it should be a strong Tower to defend them; that howsoever the gates of hell did expose themselves against them, yet they should not be able to prevail.</p>
               <p>A third thing to be noted is, that they took upon them this profession, and publique aknowledgement of invocaring the name, as in the fourth chapter of <hi>Isaiah</hi> and the first verse, <hi>Let us be called by thy name;</hi> and as it is in the ninth chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the eighteenth verse, <hi>They would be known to be a people who called upon the name of God,</hi> they took upon them the profession of a Church, and the title to be called Invocators on Gods name, whose name was their treasure, whose service their delight, and whose worship was their glory; that is, They took upon them to be called Christians and true Worshippers of God, against all others of the wicked race; which distinction is shewed after, when

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> we see what <hi>Moses</hi> meaneth by bringing these two verses into this chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Godly should not be discouraged, as if he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got his promises: Therefore he ends the chapter with
<hi>Enosh,</hi> a godly man, to shew first he will have them Worshippers, and yet such shall not be without sorrowes; and therefore <hi>Seths</hi> Sonne is called <hi>Enosh,</hi> that is, sorrow.</p>
               <p>We have heard what invocation <hi>Moses</hi> speaks of, the nature and manner of it, that it contained all the exercises of Christian ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and how it began in <hi>Enosh</hi> after a set manner, that this must be done, and should continue, notwithstanding the wicked seed of <hi>Cain</hi> doe set themselves so maliciously against it: So we see <hi>Moses</hi> hath brought us to the Roof of the Church, for till that time there was no Church; but now he hath brought us to a Congregation of such as did invocate the name of the Lord.</p>

For first, in that the Seraphin touched his mouth with a burning Cole taken from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, therein we have the element, and the word of comfort which the Prophet received, was, that the Angell said to him, <hi>Behold this Cole hath touched thy lips, and now thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sinnes purged:</hi> And there is such an Analogie and proportion between the Sereaphim and the Priests, between the Altar and the Lords Table, between the burning Cole and Bread and Wine, offered and received in the Lords Supper. As we cannot but justifie the wisdome of the ancient Church, in applying this Scripture to the holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist: For as, <hi>St. John</hi> sheweth, this vision shewed to the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> is to be understood of our Saviour Christ, <hi>John</hi> the twelfth and the fourty first verse; for saith the Evangelist, <hi>These things said Esay, when</hi>

                  <hi>he saw his glory, and spake of him;</hi> and therefore by this burning Cole taken from the Altar, is meant <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> who <hi>by the Sacrifice of his death which hee offered up to God, his Father, hath taken away our i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities, and purged our sinnes,</hi> as it is in the sixt chapter to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> and therefore for the confirmation of our Faith wee are here taught, That our sinnes are no lesse taken away by the element of bread and wine, in the Sacrament, then the Prophets sinne was by being touched with a Cole.</p>
               <p>The occasion of this touching is set downe in the former verses of this Chapter, which doe stand upon a <hi>vision</hi> and a
<hi>confession;</hi> The <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> shewed to the Prophet was, <hi>That hee saw the Lord sitting upon an high Throne, as a Judgeready to give Sentence, before whom the very Angells were forced

Upon this confession made by the Prophet there came an Angell flying from God, which by touching his lips with a hot Coale assured him that his sinne was taken away; wherefore, as by the former wee learne that wee should repent us of our sinnes when wee consider the great Majesty of God, so by this wee are taught what to hope for, that is, that if wee bee penitent God will not bee wanting unto us, but will
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:62585:283"/>send a Seraphin unto us, with a word of comfort, to assure us <hi>that all our iniquities are purged.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Two parts.</note>
                  <note place="margin">First, Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</note>The outward element appointed by God to confirme his faith, was <hi>the flying of a Seraphin unto him to touch is mouth with the Cole;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Secondly, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible grace.</note>the word or invisible grace signifyed by the element was, <hi>that by that touching his sinne was taken away.</hi> In the outward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction wee are first to consider the element it selfe, that was, <hi>the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cole on the Altar;</hi> next the application persormed by a Seraphin, who <hi>tooke the Cole from the Altar, and touched the Prophets lips.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">First, The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>First therefore considering that none can take away sinne but God only, wee must needs confesse that there was in this Cole a divine force and virtue issuing from Christ, who is the only reconciliation for our sins, without which it had not beene possible that it could have taken away sinne. But what is here said of this Cole, is to bee understood of Christ, of whom <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh in this place, <hi>When hee saw the glory of Christ, John</hi> 12. 41. for hee is the Cole by which our sinnes are taken away; There are two natures in a Cole, that is, the Cole it selfe, which is a dead thing, and the burning nature and heate that it hath; which setteth out first Christs humane nature, which is dead in it selfe; And then his divine nature, containing the burning force of that is represented in this burning Cole: So the element of bread and wine is a dead thing in it selfe, but through the grace of Gods spirit infused into it hath a power to heate our Soules: for the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Supper have an earthly and a heavenly part. Secondly, that Christ is to bee understood by this burning Cole wee may safely gather, because <hi>his love to his Church is presented with fire, Cantit.</hi> the eighth chapter and the sixth verse. It is said of Christs love, the Coles thereof are fiery Coles, and a vehement flame, such as cannot be quenched with any water, nor the floods drown it, even so all the calamities and miseries that Christ suffered and endured for our sakes, which were poured upon him as water, could not quench the love that he bare us. Thirdly, <hi>quia non solum ardet ipse, sed alios accendit,</hi> so saith
<hi>John</hi> the Baptist of him, <hi>There cometh one after me that shall Baptize with the holy-Ghost and with fire,</hi> as it is in the third chapter of <hi>Luke</hi> the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse, therefore the graces of the holy-Ghost are also represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by fire, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. the union whereof hath a double representation.

<hi>but speake the word and thy servant shall bee whole, Mat.</hi> the eighth chapter and the eighth verse; so hee can doe what he will with his only word. It pleased God to take away the Prophet: sinnes by touching his lips. And albeit he can take away our sins, without touching of bread or wine, if he will; yet in the councell of his will, he commendeth unto us the sacramentall partaking of his body and blood. It is his will; that our sins shall be taken away by the outward act of the sacrament: The reason is, not only in regard of our selves, which consist of body and soul, and therefore have need both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and Ghostly meanes; to assure us of our Salvation; but in regard of Christ himself, who is the burning Cole. Forever since God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that Christ should take our nature, and <hi>aptare sibi corpus,</hi> in the tenth chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and the fifth verse; that so he might worke our Reconciliation. As Christ became himself a man, having a bodily substance; so his actions were bodily. As in the Hypostasis of the Sun, there is both the Humane and Divine nature; so the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is of an Heavenly and Earthly nature. As he hath taken our body to himself, so he honoureth bodily things, that by them we should have our sinnes taken away from us. By one bodily sacrament he taketh away the affection unto sin, that is naturally planted in us. By another bodily Sacrament he taketh away the habituall sins, and the actuall transgressions, which proceed from the corruption of our nature. And here we have matter offered us of faith; that as he used the touching of a cole, to assure the Prophet that his sins were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:62585:285"/>so in the Sacrament he doth so elevate a peice of bread, and a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wine, and make them of such power; that they are able to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our sinnes: And this maketh for Gods glory, not only to beleeve that God can work our Salvation, without any outward means, by the inward Grace of his Spirit; but also, that he can so elevate the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of his creatures; not only the hemme of a garment, but even a strawe, (if he see it good) shall be powerfull enough, to save us from our sinnes. As Christ himself is spirituall and bodily; so he taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our sinnes, by means not only spirituall but bodily; as in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. For if there be a cleansing power in the Word, as Christ speaketh in the fifteenth chapter of <hi>John,</hi> and the third verse: If in prayer, as <hi>Peter</hi> sheweth to <hi>Simon Magus, Pray to God, that</hi> (<hi>if it be possible</hi>) <hi>the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee,</hi> in the eighth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> and the twenty second verse: If in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, and giving almes, sinnes shall be forgiven, as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in the sixteenth chapter of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and the sixth verse, <hi>Per mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordiam purgantur peccata;</hi> much more in the Sacrament, wherein both the word and prayer and the works of mercy doe concurre, to the cleansing of sinners from their sinnes: Whereas the Seraphim did not take the coale in his mouth, but with tongues; and applied it not to the Prophets care, but to his tongue. We learn, that it is not the hearing of a sermon that can cleanse us from sinne; but we must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

It is true, that meditation privately had, <hi>will kindle a fire in the hearts of many,</hi> in the thirty ninth <hi>Psalm,</hi> and the third verse: And the word, <hi>as it is a fire, Jeremie</hi> the twenty third chapter, and the twenty ninth verse, will also <hi>kindle a man, and heat him inwardly:</hi> But because in the Sacrament all those doe meete together, therefore nothing is so availeable to take away sinne, as the touching of bread and wine, with our lips.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The effect.</note>The effect of this touching followeth; wherein we are to consider, First, the efficacy of this action. Secondly, the certainty; that as sure as this coale hath touched thy lips; so surely are thy sinnes taken away. Thirdly, the speede, that so soon as the coale touched, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinne was taken away and purged. The efficacie standeth, of the removing, or taking away of sinne, and of the purging away of sinne. The taking away, and purging of sinnes, have two uses: Some have their sinnes taken away, but not purged; for something remaineth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde: Some have

And to avoid this fault, is a matter of great difficul y.</p>
               <p>For the first point, Christ saith, <hi>When ye give almes, doe not blow a trumpet; when ye fast or pray let not all the world know of it,</hi> neither let the end be <hi>ut videamini.</hi> Touching which, we are to know, that our good works are not worse in themselves for being seen, but are the better; even as the goodnesse of a colour stands in the lightnesse of it, so our good works are more commended, if they be known: And they of themselves desire the light, as Christ sheweth in <hi>John</hi> the third chapter and the twenty first verse: But such is our corruption, that if we think our works are known, we with our pride doe corrupt them. For as pride is the way to dry up the fountain of Gods grace, as <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble, James</hi> the fourth chapter. So the sight of good works is a means to overthrow our humility. The Pharisees knew this full well, which purposing to tempt Christ, covered their hooks with praise, <hi>Seeing we know that thou art a teacher come from God, and regardest no man, tell us, is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?

Mark</hi> the tenth chapter. When one said, <hi>Blessed is the womb that bare thee,</hi> he repelled that saying,
<hi>Nay rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it, Luke</hi> the eleventh chapter and the twenty eighth verse. For as the shewing of the Kings treasure was the means of the betraying them, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the thirty ninth chapter; so when we shew our good works, with a desire to be praised for them, it takes away all commendation from them.</p>
               <p>This thing being dangerous, if notwithstanding we be desirous to have our good deeds seen, that shall be fulfilled which <hi>Sirach</hi> saith, He that loveth dangers shall perish therein, <hi>Qui amat periculum peribit in co, cap</hi> 3. 27. But to disswade us from this, the Apostle saith, <hi>Be not desirous of vain glory, Galatians</hi> the fift chapter, and
<hi>Philippians</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter and the third verse. The Preacher saith, <hi>all is vanity which men seek after in this life,</hi> and therefore concludes, <hi>Time Deum, Ecclesiastes</hi> the twelfth chapter, to teach us, that without God all the praise of the world is but vanity. Now as we fail in having respect<pb n="524" facs="tcp:62585:287"/>to God: First, when we make not him the fountain of our praise: Secondly, if we make him not the end of it; so in doing good works to be seen, we commit two vanities. First, when we content not our selves with this perswasion, that God sees our works, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them: unlesse man see them and praise us for them; The try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, whether we make God the fountain of our praise, is if we seek it by wayes agreeable to his will, not by wickednesse. Secondly, not by vanity, for his delight is not in beautie, riches, or strength; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth not in any mans Legs, in the hundred and fourty sixt <hi>Psalme.</hi> Thirdly, not by falshood, as the Apostle saith,
<hi>I will not glory of any thing which the Lord hath not wrought by me,</hi> in the second to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the eleventh chapter: <hi>Hereby we shall seek the praise of God, rather than of men,</hi> in the twelfth chapter of <hi>John:</hi> nay though they seek praise by righteousnesse and doing good works, yet they make not God the fountain of their praise: the Hypocrites when they would be praised, did those works that were most glorious, as to offer sacrifice in the temple, <hi>but they neglected mercy and justice,</hi> which are the chief things that God respecteth in the twenty third chapter of <hi>Matthew: They washed not their hearts,</hi> in the fifteenth chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> which God especially regardeth, but looked only to outward things; and they that doe mercy and justice, which are the chief things of the Law, yet they will not doe them, but when they may be seen: Whereby they shew, that they make not God the fountain of their praise; and so the praise they seek for, is hatefull to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this desire of vain glory is injurious to God; when we make not him the end of our praise, for we may doe good works <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> in the sight of men, but not with purpose to have them seen, that so we may receive glory: For God hath given us the joyes and use of all his Creatures, but reserveth the glory of them to himself: therefore the Apostle saith, howsoever ye have the joy of Gods Creatures in eating and drinking, yet let God have the glory: <hi>Doe all to the glory of God,</hi> in the first to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> the tenth chapter, and the thirty first verse: For though he giveth us the use of all things, yet <hi>gloriam meam alteri non dabo,</hi> in the fourty second chapter of <hi>Esay:</hi> Therefore if we doe good works to commend our selves, and not to glorifie God, we are injurious to him; for he hath testified, that he will not give his glory to any other: And therefore
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> say, <hi>It is not by our own godlinesse that we have made this man whole, but it is the name of Christ and faith in him, that hath raised him,</hi> in the third chapter of the <hi>Acts:</hi> Therefore not only <hi>Nabuchadnezar</hi> when he snatched Gods glory to himself, was punished, in the fourth chapter of <hi>Daniell:</hi> But even <hi>Herod</hi> also, because he did but suffer that glory to rest upon him, that was attributed to him by others, when he should have ascribed all to God, in the twelfth chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> and the twenty second verse. Then as it is injurious to God, so it is hurtfull to our selves; for though we see many miracles wrought by Christ, yet they are afraid to confesse and believe him,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:62585:287"/>
                  <hi>Because they love the praise of men more than the praise of God,</hi> in the twelfth chapter of <hi>John</hi> and the fourty third verse: And therefore Christ saith, <hi>How can you believe, which seek glory one of another, and seek not the honor that commeth of God alone? quomodo potestis credere, qui gloriam sibi quaeritis?</hi> in the fift chapter of
<hi>John</hi> and the fourty fourth verse: Secondly, as it is an obstacle to grace; so it is a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to all wickednesse: For the Jews doubted not to crucisie the Lord of glory, to get praise of the wicked.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that we may doe this, Christ willeth us <hi>to take heed;</hi> for there is a double corruption in us: First, a rebellion against Gods precepts, which make us say <hi>quare,</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in the fift chapter of <hi>Exodus</hi> and the second verse: <hi>Who is the Lord that I should hear his voice?</hi> And as the Scribes and Pharisees said to Christ,
<hi>By what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority doest thou these things?</hi> in the twenty first chapter of <hi>Matthew</hi> and the three and twentieth verse: Secondly, the blindnesse of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding which makes us ask <hi>quomodo?</hi> which is the question of ignorance; so that it is not without cause, that he bids us take heed, that we beware of this sinne, as being a hard precept, both for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion to yeeld unto, and also in regard of our ignorance: which is such, as we cannot see how it should be lawfull to seek praise by well doing; the hardnesse of avoiding this sinne, is of two causes. First, it ariseth from the nature of sinne it self: for as we are corporall and visible; so we are most affected with those things that are visible, as <hi>John</hi> reasoneth, <hi>He that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen,</hi> in the first
<hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>John</hi> and the fourth chapter: whereupon it commeth to passe, that our corruption, that though we believe the reward of God to be great: yet because it is invisible, and the worlds reward is present, therefore pleaseth us more. Secondly, from the originall of vain glory; for when the woman looked upon the fruit, albeit it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleased her, yet that which did strike the stroak, was <hi>eritis sieut dii,</hi> in the third chapter of
<hi>Genesis,</hi> the hope of present glory: And this was the first sinne, that came into the soul of the woman; and as the Philosopher saith, that the heart is <hi>primum vivens &amp; ultimum mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens;</hi> so vain glory, as it first took possession in the heart of man, so it is last, and with most difficulty dispossessed: So that when a man hath mortified all his lusts; and subdued all sinnes, yet pride and the desire of glory revives again.</p>
               <p>And whereas the sinnes of the world are three, <hi>The lust of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, The lust of the eyes, and pride of life,</hi> the first Epistle of <hi>John</hi> the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> chapter and the sixteenth verse. The sinne of pride is such a one as doth not only corrupt all virtues, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all other sinnes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails against them; for gluttony or the lust of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is come under the power of pride: So as men take a pride in excesse of meat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as gluttony would be contented with a sittle; for the belly is sooner filled than the eye satisfied. Secondly, For Covetousnesse, What makes men to exceed in the cares of getting riches, but only pride and desire of glorie: For knowing <hi>that the borrower is a servant to the len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Proverbs</hi> the tenth chapter, and <hi>all things obey money, Preacher</hi> the<pb n="526" facs="tcp:62585:288"/>tenth chapter: In respect of the excellencie of wealth, they are so covetous, that albeit they have more than enough, yet they still ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together, that they may have all men in subjection to them; so hard it is to suppresse the desire of vain glory: And the harder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause where other sinnes be resting upon a man, this sinne comes cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping upon him, and flattereth him, as a thing most agreeable to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Howbeit it is to be avoided with all heedfulness, for it comes from good things as the root. Secondly, A man is proud oftentimes even of humilitie, not only when they outwardly humble themselves with fasting, but also <hi>when they are inwardly humbled, Joel</hi> the second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Secondly, it is the harder, because it comes with a colour and shew of reason; for it is Gods will that we should not only doe good works, but that it should be done openly, as Christ saith, <hi>to shine and to be seen of men, sic splendeat lux, Matthew</hi> the fifth chapter and the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse; both that God may be glorified by us, and that we may give good example to others: But not withstanding we must beware that we doe them not to purchase praise to our selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How to avoid vain glory, pride, &amp;c. and other fins, by meditation and prayer.</note>Secondly, The question of ignorance is, How we should avoid this desire of glorie, which is so bred in us? The answer to this doubt is, By medition and prayer: For as God hath laid this Curse upon the earth, <hi>That it should bring forth thorns and thistles of it self,</hi> but if we will have any good of it, we must bestow labour upon it; So this curse is laid upon our soules, that good things will not come into our mindes, without diligent meditation; but pride and such sinnes will take place of themselves without any further trouble. Wherefore as to avoid all temptations we must occupie our selves in godly meditation, as
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Semper te Diabolus inveniat occupatum;</hi> so there are speciall meditations for the avoiding of pride and the desire of vain glory: First, To think of the uncertainty of worldly glorie, that Christ that to day should have been crowned King by the Jews, was the next day crucified by them. Secondly, Of the emptinesse and vacuity of it; as that all the glory that
<hi>Haman</hi> had did not content him, when he had received but one little disgrace by <hi>Mordechai, Esther</hi> the fifth chapter. Thirdly, of the punishment of this sinne; for whereas he spares other sinnes, if he see withall some token of goodnesse, so as he will quench the smoaking flax,
<hi>Isaiah</hi> the fourty second chapter, he will not defer his judgements from the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and ambitious, but will withdraw his graces from them here, and punish them eternally in the world to come. Fourthly, We should think of our own hearts, if we doe good without regard of mens praise. Fiftly, Of our own inability, how little we are able to doe of our selves, except God move our hearts, and <hi>work in us both to will and to doe, Philippians</hi> the second chapter and the thirteenth verse, that so we may ascribe the praise of all our good deeds to him, as the only author of them.</p>
               <p>These meditations will kindle a sire in us, that we shall have a desire to speak as <hi>Psalm</hi> the thirty ninth, as the Prophet having considered, that God did command us to keep his testimonies, saith presently,

It appeareth that howsoever these corporal blessings doe carry the names of good things, yet they are not so truly called; but the truth thereof is comprehended in spiritual good things, whereof the good things of this life are but shadows. Christ by that water which the Samaritan came to draw, took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to speak of the water of life;
<hi>whereof whosoever drinketh shall thirst no more, John</hi> the fourth chapter and the fourteenth verse. And by the bread which the Capernaites sought after, took occasion to stirre them up to seek for the bread of life: So should we from the outward things, which we enjoy for the maintenance of the life present, gather spiritual meditations of true good things necessary to the life to come.</p>
               <p>Secondly, These words depend upon the former verse; Wherein Christ seeing them flock unto him, said, <hi>reseek me not because ye saw the miracles, but for that ye eat of the loves.</hi> Upon which words as he concludes with this exhortation, <hi>Labour not for the meat,</hi> &amp;c. So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gives them this counsell, he sets down the reproof. Where
<hi>Booze</hi> chargeth his servants concerning <hi>Ruthe,</hi> that they should let her gather and not rebuke her, the word signifieth to confound or put to shame, <hi>Ruth</hi> the second chapter and the fifteenth verse; the reason is, because we are all ashamed of reproof. Christ, though he had no wounds by sinne, was contented to be baptized, as if he had been a sinner; but we that have the wounds and sores of sinne, cannot abide the plaister of reproof, but think it a shame to be rebuked when we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. But Christ before he counsels them, doth think good first by reproof to put them to shame: And it is a shame to them in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects. First, That in the heat of their Religion and devotion, when they would seem most devout, Christ chargeth them with hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, <hi>Ye seek me not for the miracles,</hi> that by them ye may beleeve, but <hi>for the meat.</hi> Secondly, They are put to shame the more, for that he doth not lightly touch them, and glance at their hypocrisie, but doth accuse them in vehement and earnest manner, <hi>Verily, verily, I say to you,</hi> the twenty sixt verse; but Christ doth rebuke them for another end. Howsoever it be a good effect that men be made ashamed of their sinne by reproof, yet is it not the last end: Christ doth it not to confound, but rather to amend them; and therefore exhorts them, that they should chiefly <hi>labour for the meat that perisheth not,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in one place saith,
<hi>hoc loquor ad pudorem,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the sixt chapter and the fift verse, doth elsewhere say, <hi>I write not these things to shame you,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the fourth chapter: So Christ to these men saith, <hi>I speak not this for your confusion, but for your amendment.</hi> So that albeit they were guilty of hypocrisie, yet not desperate hypocrites; for Christ had some hope of them, and therefore ceaseth not to exhort them.</p>
               <p>Again, Christ might only have exhorted them, and not used any
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:62585:290"/>reproof; but he in wisdome thinks it meet, first to reprove them for their fault, and then to shew them how to amend it. Pride is the cause why many good exhortations have no successe. While men think it needlesse they should be rebuked, they are like the proud Pharisees <hi>that despised the counsel of God, Luke</hi> the seventh chapter and the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiech verse. But Christ to make manifest to them, that they need counsel, doth first shew them their hypocrisie: We are ready to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie our selves in all things; our corruption is such, that we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of our own sinnes, which made the Prophet to say, <hi>Cleanse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> from my secret sinnes, Psalm</hi> the nineteenth: We take them to be no sinnes, wherein we greatly offend God: Whereupon the Prophet saith, <hi>Cor hominis
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> est, Jeremiah</hi> the seventeenth chapter, only God, being greater than our heart, <hi>knoweth all things, and is able to discover all our sinnes,</hi> the first epistle of
<hi>John</hi> the third chapter: Therefore we are to pray to God, to open our eyes, that we may see the necessity of

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The people that followed Christ shewed two zeals, One was to make him King, The other to seek him, but both proceeded from one cause, because he fed them. Christ saw both these Zeals, The one he rejected utterly, and would not be made King; But he corrects the other zeal; he forbids them not to seek him, but wills them to seek him for this end, That from him they may receive the bread that endures to life everlasting.</p>
               <p>The reason why Christ would not be honoured, was of two sorts. First, For that is a slender honor, to honor God for temporal things; for as the Israelites did honor God while he fed them with bread from Heaven and gave them water out of the rocks, but so soon as they wanted either of them, then they murmured. So when God continueth his temporal blessings upon men, so long he shall be heard; but when his benefits ceaseth, then his honor ceaseth. Therefore he rejecteth this honour partly in regard of his own self, but chiefly for our cause: For howsoever it be less honourable for Christ to be honoured for outward blessings; yet the chief cause why he rejecteth it is because it is lesse profitable for us. They were desirous of temporal blessings, which he did bestow upon them: But yet he is desirous to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> upon them spiritual blessings, which, as they are better for them, so desires greater honor.</p>
               <p>The exhortation, ariseth out of the reproof, which is concluded in it: The matter of it is reduced to six points, First, <hi>

                     </gap>
                  </hi> the sixt chapter;
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:62585:290"/>for when God takes away the staffe and strength of bread, it hath no more power to preserve life. So that man liveth not by bread of it self, for it perisheth. Whereas bread hath two powers, the one to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the hungry stomach, the other to restore the body being weak; we see it loseth both these powers: the power of satisfying doth not continue; for though a man satisfie himself never so much with it to day, yet to morrow he will crave more, and his stomach will waxe emptie. As for the power to restore, albeit during health, it strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth mans heart, yet if once sicknesse come, it hath no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store strength. Secondly, Whatsoever maintains the joyes of life, that perisheth also, <hi>for the world passeth away and the fashion thereof,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the seventh chapter, and the first epistle of <hi>John</hi> the second chapter, and whatsoever may make mans life joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The pleasures of this life, which are the causes of our joy, are transitory; and though they could continue with us, yet we our selves must passe away and leave them; yea even while we may take the pleasures of this world, yet old age will approach, and the dayes wherein we shall say, <hi>I have no pleasure in them, Ecclesiastes</hi> the twelfth chapter and the first verse.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though this bread decay, yet our Saviour telleth us, that men are so foolish, they gave themselves wholly to seek it. And that this is true, will appear, if we look upon our actions, either civil or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; If we consider either the care we take for this life, or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence we use in Gods service. Of the first care we have an example in <hi>Martha,</hi> against inordinate care of this life: Our Saviour rebuketh <hi>Martha, who was troubled about many things, Luke</hi> the tenth chapter; and so <hi>we doe rise so early and take such pains for this life, Psalm</hi> one hundred twenty seven, that is the service of <hi>Baal</hi> was more painfull, than the service of the true God. So we take more pains <hi>in the service of the three Gods of this world,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>John</hi> the second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>than of the true good:</hi> The same appears if we consider our care in matters of Religion: Wherein we must confesse, that our special joyes are in the things of this life, and for the bread of it. These men whom Christ here reproveth, were not about their Trades, but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in a matter of Religion, then to hear Christ and to see his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: and yet we see that under colour of sowing to the spirit, they did but sow to the flesh, <hi>and make provision for the same, Galatians</hi> the sixt chapter. And howbeit <hi>Maries</hi> part be the better, and the actions of religion more excellent than the actions of this life, yet <hi>they seek their own things and not the things that are Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is a bread that doth not perish. Christ commends the care of spiritual things under them four: First negatively, <hi>Labour not for that bread which perisheth.</hi> Secondly affirmatively, <hi>Labour for that which endureth;</hi> This life doth not last for ever: but after this life there is another life, which shall be everlasting: And as it is a life, so there is a food for it, which we must labour for: without which we shall not attain to that life, no more then we can continue in life here, unlesse we have the food appointed for it, <hi>Apudte fons vitae,</hi> 
                  <pb n="532" facs="tcp:62585:291"/>
                  <hi>Psalm</hi> the thirty sixt, <hi>and with him is fulnesse of joy, Psalm</hi> the sixteenth. Now we have the one life and the joyes of it, out of the consideration of the Creature; but then we shall have life and joy from God the Creator, who is the fountain of joy and life. Therefore howsoever we labour in this life to lay up treasure for our outward maintenance, yet we must chiefly take care for the life to come, <hi>and lay up for our souls a good foundation,</hi> the first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to
<hi>Timothie</hi> the sixt chapter; but the following of the good things of this life doth hinder us from this care. We are like the Israelites that cared not for the promised bread, because they had the flesh pots in <hi>Egypts,</hi> so as they could be content to have turned thither: So it was with the two tribes and half; who for that they had convenient pasture for their Cattel on the other side of <hi>Jordan, cared not for travelling into the land of Canaan, Numbers</hi> the thirty fift chapter. Another hindrance is, the labor and trouble that must be suffered, for the purchasing of eternal life. We have a spiritual sluggishnesse, like the sloathfull person whom <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> speaketh of, He would fain have had bread, but was loth to labour for it;
<hi>It was cold and there was a Lyon in the way, Proverbs</hi> the twenty second chapter. So the great trouble and danger that must be born, doth keep us from seeking the bread of eternall life, as the Israelites said, <hi>The Land is a good Land, but the People are many and strong, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> the thirteenth chapter, and so had no lust to seek to enter into the land of
<hi>Canaan:</hi> So we confesse that eternall life is the better, but we have so many comforts in this life, and finde it so troublesome to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the other life, that we leave off all care for it, and content our selves with our
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> state: The trouble and danger that stayeth us from seeking life eternal, is that which the Scripture setteth out, <hi>All that will live godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer persecution,</hi> the second epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> the third chapter.
<hi>By many tribulations we must enter into the kingdome of Heaven, Acts</hi> the fourteenth chapter <hi>And the way is narrow and the gate streight that leadeth to life, Luke</hi> the thirteenth chapter.</p>
               <p>To take away the first hindrance, the holy Ghost sheweth, that there is a better life and greater joyes reserved in the life to come, <hi>The eye hath not seen, the eare hath not heard,</hi> the first epistle to the
<hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> the second chapter. And, that the other should not hinder us, he saith, <hi>All the afflictions in this life are not worthy of the glory that shall be revealed, Romans</hi> the eight chapter. In both which places we see God would kindle in us a desire of eternal life: As there is a life that endureth, so there is a meat for it. We know the body needs bread, therefore we seek for bread for it: so must we seek for the food of the soul. The joy of the body must be a memorial to stirre us up, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide food for the soul.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This food we doe not seek: We are so intangled in the pleasures of this life, that we think not of eternall life; the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of this life, while we enjoy them, doe quench the care of the life to come: But being once past, they are as nothing, and we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better for them; though we desire eternall life, yet we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade<pb n="533" facs="tcp:62585:291"/>our selves we shall have it without feeking the food for it. We think it necessary to seek bread for the body, but not for the soul; though we doe think it necessary, yet we neglect it, and deny in our works, that we think it needfull: We doe not labour for it, as we are here commanded: The sluggard would fain have bread, but shall want it, because he labours not for it in temporal things, as riches, honour, preferment, a great deal will not content men: But in Religion and matters spiritual, they are of <hi>Agrippaes</hi> minde,
<hi>aliquantulum persuades, Acts</hi> the twenty fourth chapter, great store of worldly goods is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a few good works are sufficient; If we sow to the spirit in never so little measure, we think we have done a great deal; but if we sow never so much to the flesh upon apparel and vanity all is too little; if we spend all the six dayes about our own profit, yet it is not enough, but we will encroach upon the Sabbath; therefore the people ask, <hi>When will the Sabbath be ended? Amos</hi> the eighth chapter; But if we spend but one day in the week, or one hour in Gods service, it is tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them. We take part with <hi>Martha;</hi> and as for <hi>Mary,</hi> that was occupied about Gods worship, we think not so well of her, though Christ testifie of her, <hi>that she chose the better part, Luke</hi> the tenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: If we vouchsafe once in seven dayes to come unto Gods house, yet it shall be late before we come, and we think it long till we be gone.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Novemb. 19. 1598.</note>AFter the four points of accusation, before handled, now follow two more for direction, First,
<hi>That we must seek for the bread of life that endureth,</hi> rather than for
<hi>that which perisheth.</hi> Secondly, That <hi>we must seek for it of the sonne of Man, whom God the father hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sealed,</hi> that he should give us the bread of life.</p>
               <p>In the first part we have two parts to observe.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That we must labour for this meat:</hi> Secondly,
<hi>We must labour for it more than for the other.</hi> When Christ saith
<hi>labour,</hi> he means not that they should only desire it: It is a good thing to desire the bread of life as they desire it, <hi>Da nobis semper panem hunc, John</hi> the sixt chapter and the thirty fourth verse. Those sodain flashings that arise are not to be despised, for they are the seed of greater virtues: God begins with a little seed of Godlinesse, and proceeds till he have wrought men to some perfection. <hi>Zacheus</hi> at the first did but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to see Christ; but from this little seed proceeded great fruit of Justice and mercie towards the poor, so that he not only <hi>restored,</hi> but
<hi>gave to the poor, Luke</hi> the nineteenth chapter. Therefore the seed of
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:62585:292"/>repentance and faith, if it be never so little, is not to be rejected, if it be but as the grain of mustard seed; <hi>He that doth not quench the smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king flax,</hi> though it doe not flame, <hi>Matthew</hi> the twelfth chapter, will not despise the least desire of Gods grace: but that we should not content our selves only to desire the bread of life, he wills us not only to desire, but to <hi>labour</hi> for it: It is not enough to long and desire for the bread of life, but we must labour and take pains for it: <hi>The desire of the sloathfull shall slay him, Proverbs</hi> the twenty fourth chapter: The sloathfull would fain have bread to sustain life, but he saith,
<hi>There is a Lyon in the way, Proverbs</hi> the twenty second chapter, he is afraid of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and danger; but we must not refuse to take any pains, nor fear any danger, to obtein <hi>the bread that endureth for ever.</hi> In other things of this life we doe not only desire that which seemeth good to us, but we seek for it till we have it. So the Prophet speaks, <hi>Cupiunt &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt, Michah</hi> the second chapter and the second verse: So we must not only desire the Kingdome of God, but must violently seek after it; for <hi>The Kingdome of God suffereth violence, Matthew</hi> the eleventh chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this word <hi>labor</hi> is opposed to seeking: for Christ saith here, <hi>Matthew</hi> the sixt chapter, <hi>Seek the Kingdome of God, but labor for the meat that endureth,</hi> This labor is that work of God which is ascribed to faith, <hi>John</hi> the sixt chapter, <hi>by which we labor for the bread of life,</hi> we must use an excessive kinde of labor, in this work of God, for that to labor for the bread of life, is no bodily labor, and therefore we must work for it earnestly: <hi>for cursed is he that doth the work of the Lord negligently, Jeremiah</hi> the fourty eight chapter, Therefore when Christ pronounceth them blessed that <hi>hunger and thirst after righteousnesse,</hi> he commands us not only to seek and desire it in our hearts, but to hunger for it as we doe for the food of our bodies,
<hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> the fifth chapter, and as he commands us to doe so, so he hath left us his example, for as it becomes him to fulfill all righteousnesse; so he protesteth, <hi>that it was his meat and drink, to doe the will of him that sent him, John</hi> the fourth chapter; so did <hi>Mary</hi> earnestly labor for the meat that perisheth not, when she was sitting at the feet of Jesus: for though her sister called upon her to help her, yet nothing could draw her from this spirituall labor, <hi>Luke</hi> the tenth chapter and the fourty second verse: So did the people labor that pressed to hear Christ,
<hi>Luke</hi> the eighth chapter, they laid violence to the Kingdome of God: as also they that hearing <hi>Paul</hi> preach, would needs have him preach the same thing again to them: and for that end came together in great companies to hear the next Sabbath, <hi>Acts</hi> the thirteenth chapter: If we thus seek the bread of life, striving and wrastling with God in our praiers, as
<hi>Jacob</hi> did with the Angell, then we doe indeed labor for it, as Christ willeth us to doe.</p>
               <p>The second sense of laboring is, that we must labor for this bread more than for the other, and not at all for the other, in comparison of this. All grant that we must labor for the bread of life, but not for it more than for that which nourisheth this life: we must observe, in
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:62585:292"/>what manner we ought to labour, as well as that we are to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: for the excessive desire of this life, makes us defective in the desire of the life to come. The desire of this life is not oppofice; but subordinate to the desires of the life to come: But we must desire this life, so farre as it may further us to the other life.

Men are bound to be carefull to make honest provision for this life, and not to be idle and burdensome to the earth: For when Christ willeth us not to be carefull for this life, yet from the example of birds we may learn, that we must not be negligent, for <hi>they are made to flie,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Provarbs:</hi> And so we are by Gods appointment <hi>to provide for our maintenance in this life, Matthew</hi> the sixt chapter.

               <p>Thus we are to provide for this life. But if comparison be made, we are to labour more for the life to come, and for the food that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the maintenance of it. It were a thing hard enough for us, if Christ should command us to labour for the heavenly food, as we doe for the earthly; but yet it is necessary, that as the soul is more excellent than the body; so we should be more carefull to maintain the life of the soul, than of the body. The excellency of the soul made the learned Philosophers to

                  <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by faith before works, <hi>not when he was circumcised, but when he was uncircumcised, Romans</hi> the fourth chapter and the tenth verse. But <hi>James</hi> saith,
<hi>Abraham our Father was justified by Works, James</hi> the second chapter and the twenty first verse. To reconcile the Apostles, we must know, that the power of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which, in <hi>Paul,</hi> is <hi>effective;</hi> But that which <hi>James</hi> speaketh of is <hi>declarative:</hi> It was
<hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith that made him righteous; and his works did only declare him to be justified: Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>That albeit good works have no power to justifie, yet they are good and profitable for men, Titus</hi> the third chapter; For they declare our justification, which is by faith; and by them we make our selves sure of our calling and election, the second epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the first chapter and the tenth verse.</p>
               <p>In these two verses <hi>Peter</hi> delivers two things: First, A Rule, by which we may examine our selves. Secondly, An application of the same. Seeing we have such a good Rule to try whether we be elected and called, let us study by the practise of these virtues, to assure our selves of our calling and election.</p>
               <p>Two things commend this Rule, which the holy Ghost sets down, First, That it is <hi>Regula negativa;</hi> For having said before affirmatively, <hi>If these things be in you and abound, they will make you that you shall not be idle nor unfruitfull in the knowledge of Christ.</hi> Now he speaks nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>But if you have them not, you are blinde;</hi> which is more than if<pb n="546" facs="tcp:62585:298"/>he had contented himself with his affirmative speech: For as the tree in the Garden was called <hi>Arbor scientiae boni, Genesis</hi> the second chapter, though directly it brings us to the knowledge of nothing but evill, because <hi>Adam</hi> knew not what a good thing it was to be obedient, till he felt the smart of his disobedience: So we doe perceive the goodnesse of things by the want of them, better than by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of them. The benefit of possessing the graces of Gods spirit, doth not so much move us as the want of them. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith,
<hi>If ye care not for being fruitfull in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> yet let this perswade you to practise all these vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; for that if you be without them, <hi>you are blinde.</hi> And as no man knoweth what a benefit it is to have sight, so well as a blinde man that wants it; so it is with them that practise not these virtues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it is a universal Rule, <hi>Whosoever hath not these things:</hi> For our nature is inclined to take exception against good rules; As <hi>John Baptist, when he willed all men to bring forth fruit wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of repentance:</hi> Nor as the Jews, not to say, <hi>We have Abraham to our Father, Matthew</hi> the third chapter. It is our corruption, as the Apostle faith, <hi>to think that we shall escape the plagues of God for these sinnes, which we condemn in others, Romans</hi> the second chapter: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour prevented that exception, when speaking to his Disciples, he said,
<hi>Quod vobis dico omnibus dico, Mark</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter. Even so
<hi>Peter</hi> saith, Whosoever wants these virtues, whatsoever occasion he pretends for the want of them, <hi>he is blinde, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to speak more particularly of this Rule, two things make us se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the matter of our Salvation, which notwithstanding, <hi>We should work out with fear and trembling, Philippians</hi> the second chapter and the twelfth verse.</p>
               <p>The one is, our Knowledge: We are ready to say with <hi>Job, I know that my Redeemer liveth, Job</hi> the nineteenth chapter: But unlesse we perform somthing else, it shall be in vain to make this allegation, <hi>Have not we prophecied in thy name? Matthew</hi> the seventh chapter.</p>
               <p>The other cause of confidence and carelesnesse is the opinion we have, that it makes no matter how we live, <hi>The blood of Christ doth purge me from all sinne,</hi> the epistle of <hi>John</hi> the first chapter and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth verse.</p>
               <p>To these two the holy Ghost opposeth two things. First, Doe we think we know God <hi>and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent?</hi> Yea; but he that knoweth not these virtues, <hi>is blinde, and knoweth nothing.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Doe we think, we need not to be carefull of holinesse of life, because we are purged by Christs blood? <hi>But except we be carefull to walk in newnesse of life, we have forgotten that we were purged from our old sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first point, That he that hath not these virtues, <hi>is blinde,</hi> we are to know, That albeit there be no opposition between knowledge and wickednesse of life, because all that know Gods will, doe not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it, yet there is a necessary dependance between them; <hi>If ye love</hi>
                  <pb n="547" facs="tcp:62585:298"/>
                  <hi>me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>keep my commandements, John</hi> the fifteenth chapter. And the Preacher, <hi>Seek for the mysterie of faith, as in a pure conscience,</hi> the first epistle of
<hi>Timothy</hi> and the third chapter: <hi>For they that put away a good conscience, make shipwrack of faith,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>Timos thie</hi> the first chapter and the nineteenth verse. The Gentils did know God, but did not glorifie him as God: They knew the truth, but did <hi>detinere veritatem in injustitiâ, Romans</hi> the first chapter. As they held knowledge, so they should not withhold it from others, but should have made manifest the same, that others might have known God; which because they did not, God gave them over to be darkned in their understanding. We must manifest our knowledge by doing some good works; for he that hath knowledge, and is not carefull to be fruitfull in the knowledge of Christ, is in the half way to be blinded; for when men receive not <hi>the love of the truth, that they may be saved, God will send them the efficacie of error, that they may beleeve lies,</hi> the second epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> the second chapter and the eleventh verse. This knowledge is but a shew of knowledge, and not the power of it, <hi>If any man think he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing as he ought to know it,</hi> the second epistle to the <hi>Corintbians</hi> the eighth chapter and the seventh verse. This knowledge is like that which
<hi>John</hi> Baptist speaketh of, <hi>Matthew</hi> the third chapter,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Think not to say with your selves,</hi> &amp;c. rest not in this knowledge.</p>
               <p>The rule of true knowledge is, when it is accompanied with holinesse of life, as he speaks, <hi>If any man love God, he is known of him,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the eighth chapter and the third verse. The virtue that openeth mens eyes, to make them see, is wisdome: So he that hath no care of virtue, is not wise; for, <hi>the fear of God is wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and to depart from evill is understanding, Job</hi> the twenty eighth chapter: And <hi>to fear God, is the beginning of wisdome, Proverbs</hi> the first chapter. The Art of sowing is of pollicy, so is buying and selling;
<hi>But the Kingdom of God is likened to the traffique of a Merchant man; and to the sowing of seed, Matthew</hi> the thirteenth chapter, To teach us, that to our knowledge we must ad spiritual wisdom, without which we are blinde and ignorant. <hi>He that is blinde, nescit quò vadit, John</hi> the twelfth chapter; He considers not how he lives, whether he be in the way that leadeth to life or to death; he knows not what shall come to him after this life;
<hi>Incedit tanquam Bos, He goeth as an Oxe to the slaughter, Proverbs</hi> the seventh chapter: But he that <hi>to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge adds godlinesse and holinesse of life,</hi> he knoweth whither he goeth, <hi>That it shall goe well with him at the last, Ecclesiastes</hi> the eighth chapter and the twelfth verse. So saith the Prophet, <hi>Marke the righteous, and thou shalt see his end is peace at the last, Psalme</hi> the thirty seventh and the thirty seventh verse.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He is not only blinde, but <hi>cannot see a farre off.</hi> Two things are said to be a farre off things Spiritual and eternall; and he that hath not these Christia virtues, cannot see a farre off, neither in things spiritual nor eternall.</p>
               <p>For the first, The favour of the world makes a man commit many
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:62585:299"/>sinnes; but the favour of God keeps him from sinne. Worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures make a man commit many sinnes; but the pleasure of the life to come and the joyes of the holy Ghost, make a man forbear sinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For things eternall, the evill estate of the wicked is very bad, be his temporal estate never so good: therefore they are to consider
<hi>what God will doe in the end thereof, Quod fiat in fine, Jeremiah</hi> the fift chapter and the thirty first verse. The least pleasure that the wicked have in this life, brings <hi>poenas inferni:</hi> And howsoever Godly men be subject to miseries in this life, yet their eternal estate is most happy: <hi>I know that it shall goe well with them at the last, Isaiah</hi> the third chapter and the tenth verse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He hath forgotten that he was purged.</hi> Wherein we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
               <p>First, How true this is, There are so many perswasions arising from the benefit of the purging of our sinnes, that it is confest, <hi>that he hath forgotten that he was purged,</hi> that is, not carefull to obtain these vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: First, <hi>That God passeth over the time of our former ignorance, Acts</hi> the seventeenth chapter; Admonishesh us now to repentance, <hi>That it is enough that we have spent the time past of our life,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the fourth chapter. The consideration of this should make us to become holy. The Prophet saith, <hi>When thou hast enlarged my heart, I will runne the way of thy commandements, Psalme</hi> the hundred nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth. But what doth enlarge our hearts so much, as that all our former sinnes are washed away in the blood of Christ, <hi>That now we shall runne the way and race of holinesse, not in the spirit of fear, but of adoption, Romans</hi> the eighth chapter; <hi>Not as servants, but as children, in obedience to God our father, we need not to fear the curse of the Law, which Christ hath delivered us from, Galatians</hi> the third chapter; Only, <hi>we may look for temporal plagues, if we sinne against God, Psalm</hi> the eighty ninth. Secondly, If we consider how we are purged, the which would perswade us hereunto, that is, <hi>Not by corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the blood of Christ</hi> the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the second chapter, <hi>But with the blood of Christ, not a prophane and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon blood, Hebrews</hi> the tenth chapter, <hi>but a pretious blood.</hi> Thirdly, If we consider the end of our purging, which is, not to continue in sin, but, as Christ saith, <hi>I will refresh you, that you may take my yoke upon you, and be obedient unto me, Matthew</hi> the eleventh chapter: <hi>The father purgeth the branches, that they may bring forth more fruit, John</hi> the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter: And <hi>Christ gave himself for us, that he might purge us, to be zealous of good works, Titus</hi> the second chapter and the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse. Whereby we see it is true, That he which hath not care of holinesse, <hi>hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We are to consider how evill a thing it is, <hi>to forget the purging of our former sinnes;</hi> which we shall perceive, if we consider what a benefit it is to have them cleansed. When Gods benefits upon us are fresh, they somwhat affect us for a time, but we presently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them: And we are sorie for our sinnes, while they are fresh and<pb n="549" facs="tcp:62585:299"/>newly committed, and feel the plague of God upon us; so that we can say with <hi>David I have sinned and done wickealy,</hi> in the second of
<hi>Samuel,</hi> and the twenty fourth chapter, but the remembrance of them soon departeth away; <hi>But howsoever we forget them, yet God will remember them, and punish them to the third and fourth generation, Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> the twentieth chapter: His patience towards us, whereby he would draw us to repentance, makes us think him like our selves, that he doth forget our old sinnes as we doe, <hi>but he will set them before us, and

<hi>told him hee would dine at his house, he came downe and received him joyfully, Luke</hi> the ninteenth chapter and the fifth verse.
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> desire offereth three things to bee considered. First,
<hi>What he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desired to see,</hi> that is, <hi>Christ's day.</hi> Secondly, the desire it selfe, <hi>hee leaped for joy.</hi> Thirdly, the <hi>reason of this great desire.</hi> For the first, <hi>hee desired to see the day of Christ,</hi> which receiveth three senses, either the day of his
<hi>Deitie,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> expounds it; or the day of his
<hi>Passion,</hi> as <hi>Chrysostome;</hi> or the day of his
<hi>Nativitie,</hi> as <hi>Ireneus</hi> interprets it; for any of these are sufficient matter of desire, as Christ tells his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Luke</hi> the seventeenth chapter and the two and twentith verse: But as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that day of Christ which wee should chiefly desire to see, is that joyfull day of his birth; whereof the Angels brought word, a day of great joy to all the people, <hi>that this day is born a Saviour, Luke</hi> the second chapter.</p>
               <p>In the desire it self, we are to consider two things; First, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: Secondly, the Manner of this Desire.</p>
               <p>First for the Degree, It is noted in the word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for joy of that day, in regard of the great benefit which should come unto the world by Christs birth: Which joy the babe, <hi>John</hi> Baptist, expressed; who, before he was borne, <hi>leaped in his Mothers womb, Luke</hi> the first chapter and the fourty first verse. The joyfull desire here mentioned is, as <hi>St. Peter</hi> speaks, a joy unspeakable and glorious, the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> and the eighteenth chapter; To teach us, that the day of Christs comming in the flesh is a day most of all to be desired, and a matter of the greatest joy that can be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the Manner of this Desire. It was a desire joyned with trust and confidence, without which our desire is in vain, be it never so hot. <hi>Abrahams</hi> desire of seeing Christs day, was joyned with hope that he should see it, which he so much desired. The Creatures desire to see the day of their redemption; <hi>for they groan, Romans</hi> the eighth chapter; but this desire is without hope. These desires are both to be seen in
<hi>Jacob:</hi> For when his sonnes, being sent from <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> told him that <hi>Joseph</hi> was alive, and was Governor in the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> his heart wavered: Then he had a desire to see <hi>Joseph,</hi> but it was not joyned with hope; for he beleeved them not: But when they told him
<hi>Josephs</hi> words, and shewed him the Chariots that were sent for to bring him, then he had a desire with hope, and <hi>his spirit revived within him, Genesis</hi> the fourty fift chapter and the twenty sixt verse. The hope that he conceived of seeing him whom he desired to see, made him rejoyce.</p>
               <p>Touching the Reason of this desire, he had sufficient matter of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent joy, for he was exceeding rich in Cattel and Silver and Gold,
<hi>Genesis</hi> the thirteenth chapter and the second verse. Why then doth he long after a joy to come? The reason is, though God had blessed him with aboundance of temporal blessings, yet he considered a day would come, <hi>when his present joy should be taken from him, John</hi> the
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:62585:301" rendition="simple:additions"/>sixteenth chapter: Therefore he desires a joy that had a foundation, that is not earthly, <hi>but heavenly joyes, Hebrews</hi> the eleventh chapter, <hi>Such as should not be taken from him, John</hi> the sixteenth chapter and the twenty second verse; as <hi>Job knew that his Redeemer lived, Job</hi> the nineteenth chapter. So <hi>Abrabam</hi> desired a Redeemer, and such a one he had: For thus saith the Lord which redeemeth
<hi>Abraham, Isaiah</hi> the fourty ninth chapter and the twenty second verse;
<hi>That might redeem his soul from Hell, Psalm</hi> the fourty ninth; And
<hi>his body out of the dust of death, Psalm</hi> the twenty second for he confessed himself <hi>to be both dust and ashes, Genesis</hi> the eighteenth chapter. Dust in regard of his nature, and therefore subject to corruption; but ashes in regard of his sinnes, by which he is subject to everlasting condemnation; in respect of both he desired a Redeemer, that might deliver both his body from death and his soul from destruction, that might say <hi>revertite silii, Psalm</hi> the ninetieth and the third verse. He considered he needed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for his soul and body, that he might not be dust and ashes; and therefore exceedingly desired one that would deliver his soul from being ashes, and his body from the dust.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he saw Christs day, the notice of Gods eternal mercie herein was <hi>Abrahams</hi> desire; by whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample all that will see Christ, must first desire the sight of him, as he did, <hi>Et desiderium sit eum spectare:</hi> Though <hi>Abraham</hi> did not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally see Christ in the flesh, yet he had a desire, which was all one as if he had seen him with bodily eyes: For if the concupiscence only of evill be sinne, though the act follow not; then desire of that which is good is accepted, albeit it be not actually performed: therefore <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> prayeth, <hi>Hearken to thy servants that desire to fear thy name, Nehemiah</hi> the first chapter and the eleventh verse: The very <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirsting after righteousnesse is effectual to blessednesse, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> the fift chapter: When we can say with <hi>David, Coepit anima me a desider are justitias tuas, Psalm</hi> the hundred and nineteenth. We desire to be more desirous of it, as a thing acceptable before God; and though our soul desire not, yet the want of it is our woe, and the fainting of our joyes, while we say, <hi>When wilt thou comfort us? Psalme</hi> the hundred and nineteenth: Those are <hi>as the bruised reed and smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king flax, which he will not quench, Isaiah</hi> the fourty second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Abraham</hi> did see was Christs day; which is true in what sense soever we take it, <hi>He saw the day of his Deity, Genesis</hi> the eighteenth chapter, the second and third verses, when
<hi>seeing three men he ran to meet them, and bowed himself to the ground, saying, Lord,</hi> which was a vision of the Trinity. Secondly, For the day of his death and passion, he saw that too, <hi>Genesis</hi> the twenty second chapter and the fourteenth verse, when <hi>Abraham</hi> making the great promise of his obedience, by sacrificing his sonne upon mount <hi>Moriah;</hi> when after Christ was crucified said, <hi>In mane

                  <pb n="554" facs="tcp:62585:302"/>the thirteenth chapter, but <hi>As the starres of Heaven, Genesis</hi> the fifteenth chapter; By which is meant the blessing of Heaven: This blessing was, That he should enjoy <hi>those things which the eye bath not seen,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the second chapter and the ninth verse. Thirdly, That this blessing should come to him <hi>per semen suum,</hi> not by a strange or foraign means; this did increase <hi>Abrahams</hi> joy to think <hi>quod Servator Abrahae, est semen Abrahae:</hi> And that he whom
<hi>David</hi> called <hi>his Lord</hi> was his sonne, <hi>Matthew</hi> the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty second chapter. Fourthly, His joy was the greater, considering that this benefit was not appropriated to the Jews only that were of the stock of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> but <hi>that in him all Nations should be blessed;</hi> not only he and all his children, but as many as were to be blessed, should obtain this blessednesse in him. So say the Angels, that the birth of Christ is matter of the Peoples joy, because it belongs <hi>to all People, Luke</hi> the second chapter, <hi>That in this life all that are blessed with faithfull Abraham, Galatians</hi> the third chapter, And after this life shall be blessed, by
<hi>being received into Abrahams bosome, Luke</hi> the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter. For the manner of his joy, As his desiring sight was spiritual, so his joy is not carnal, as ours, but spiritual. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to see the feast of Christs nativity, and we joy when it comes, but in a carnal manner; but it must be spiritual as <hi>Mary</hi> saith, <hi>My spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour, Luke</hi> the second chapter. There is a joy of the countenance, which is outward; but the true joy is of the heart and conscience.</p>
               <p>To desire Christs dayes before he come, and to joy when he is come, are the true touchstones of our love to him. When our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents heard God was come, <hi>they hid themselves, Genesis</hi> the third chapter. So he that is in state of sinne, desires not Gods comming or presence, neither rejoyce at it. They say, <hi>Let the holy one of Israel cease from before us, Isaiah</hi> the thirtieth chapter and the eleventh verse; So farre are they off from desiring his comming: And for joying when he is come, they will say with the Gergasites, <hi>Depart out of our Coasts, Matthew</hi> the eighth chapter and the thirty fourth verse. But contrariwise the godly, to testifie their desire, say, <hi>Break the Heavens and come down, Psalme</hi> the hundred fourty fourth
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> So for joy, <hi>The hope that is deferred makes the heart to faint; but when it comes, it is as a tree of life, Proverbs</hi> the thirteenth chapter and the twelfth verse: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must proceed from desire to sight, and by it, as also by our joy, we conceive at the day of Christs birth, we may examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be the children of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and so may conceive hope to be partakers of blessing with him. But if we rejoyce as the carnal Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites did, of whom it is said,
<hi>The People sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play, Exodus</hi> the thirty second chapter and the sixt verse. If we testifie our joy by eating and drinking, that is no true joy, <hi>Our

               <p>In those words we have first a Prophecie: Secondly, A Reason rendred. In the first we have to consider, First, The calling of the People: Secondly, Of the Princes of the people.</p>
               <p>First, touching <hi>the God of Abraham,</hi> it is Christ, whose day <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> desired to see, and in seeing whereof he did so much rejoyce, <hi>John</hi> the eight chapter, that is, not only the day of his birth, which he saw, as we learn by the oath which he caused his servant to take, <hi>Genesis</hi> the twenty fourth chapter; but also the day of his passion, which he saw long agoe and rejoyced in seeing of it, when he said to his sonne <hi>Isaac</hi> in the mount, <hi>The Lord will provide a sacrifice, Hic pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videbit Dominus, Genesis</hi> the twenty second chapter and the eighth verse.</p>

To gather the Gentils into the Church of Christ, and to be <hi>of the people of the God of Abraham;</hi> which thing was not only foreshewed, but plainly performed: For not only there came of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The second thing in the Prophecy is, that not only the People should be gathered to be of the Church, but the Kings and Princes: for when
<hi>Peter</hi> saw <hi>the sheet let down from heaven, Acts</hi> the tenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the eleventh verse, he was taught, that Nations should come immediatly to the Church, for then <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and others were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the faith, but Princes came not till three hundred yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that was performed; when the Prophet foretelleth <hi>the poore shall eate and be satisfied, Psalme</hi> the two and twentith and the twenty sixth; but for Rulers it was not so performed, therefore the Pharisees ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>Doe any of the Rulers beleeve, but this simple People that know not the Law? John</hi> the seventh Chapter, therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>you knew your calling, that not many noble, not many mightie, but the base and weake things hath God chosen,</hi> as it is in the first of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> a great number of the poore people were at the first joyned to the Church of Christ; and not only they, but as it was foretold, <hi>the rich upon earth shall eate and worship, Psalme</hi> the two and twentith and the twenty ninth verse, so
<hi>Sergius Paulus, Acts</hi> the thirteenth, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man of <hi>Berea, Acts</hi> the seventeenth the Eunuch, chief governor for the Queene of
<hi>Ethiopia, Acts</hi> the eighth chapter; her Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer and the elect Lady, the second Epistle of Saint <hi>John</hi> and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter. So both Lords and Ladies were brought to the Church, but as yet no Princes, for they stood up against Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> the fourth chapter; both
<hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> gathered themselves against Christ, the holy sonne of God; <hi>Paul</hi> had almost got one King to the Church, that is,
<hi>Agrippa, Acts</hi> the twenty sixt chapter and the twenty eighth verse;
<hi>Thou almost perswadest mee,</hi> &amp;c. but there must bee a time when the kings of <hi>Arabia shall bring presents, Psalme</hi> the seventy second; a time when <hi>Kings should bee foster fathers, and Queenes nursing mothers to the Church, Isa.</hi> the fourty ninth chapter, therefore under the Law he confirmed the hope of Kings, by shewing grace to the King of <hi>Ninevey,</hi> who repented at the preaching of <hi>Jonas,</hi> and to the <hi>Queen of the South, who came to honour Salomon, Matthew</hi> the twelfth chapter, no less than he confirmed the hope of the poor, by calling the poor Widdow of
<hi>Zarepta,</hi> and of the humble, by the example of <hi>Naaman, Luke</hi> the fourth chapter; by whose example all sorts of people, both poor and rich, both Prince and Subject have hope be gathered into the Church, wherein the people of this Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Nation have speciall cause to magnifie God; for the first prince that professed the Gospel, was <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, born in <hi>England;</hi> and ever since Christ hath had a Church of the Gentils, <hi>not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed Gentils, John</hi> the seventh chapter, a few only of them to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, <hi>but the fulness of the Gentils, Romans</hi> the eleventh chapter: Now not only the simple and unlearned people, but the Rulers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves doe follow Christ, <hi>John</hi> the seventh chapter, wherein we are to exalt &amp; magnifie the power of Christ, that he contents not himself with the inferiour people, to be worshipped of them: he will not

<hi>Togati,</hi> such as delighted in peace, but <hi>Armati,</hi> men of warre, and hard to be brought under, to the obedience of the Gospel, such persons as at their pleasure will not hear when they think good, <hi>but take away their life, Esther</hi> the 6. chap. These men were the harder to be subdued to Christ, being without Religion for the most part, <hi>Nulla fides pietasque viris qui Castra sequuntur, The Rulers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall come to thee,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Psalms.</hi> God would not have <hi>David</hi> build him an Altar, <hi>because he was a man of warre, and had shed blood,</hi> the first book of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> the twenty eighth chapter and the third verse: But to gather a Church and Temple of the Gentils, he hath no respect of that, but sheweth his power in bringing them to his Church, which were most cruel.

Again, that they should doe this of themselves voluntarily without constraint; that where they had occupied their shields upon Gods People, now they should use them for their defense; that they should bring bountifull gifts to the Church: whereof we see examples in the new Testament,
<hi>Matthew</hi> the second chapter.</p>
               <p>The Reason is to be taken four wayes.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>When God shall be exalted, then shall the Princes of the people be gathered to the people of the God of Abraham.</hi> This is true; for this <hi>Psalme</hi> is of Christs ascention, of which Christ saith,
<hi>When he is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, omnes traham ad me, John</hi> the twelfth chapter: So that it is as much as if the Prophet should say, When Christ is exalted, then the Nations shall come to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>When the Princes of the people be gathered to the

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ple of Abraham, then shall Christ be exalted;</hi> that is, when the Kings of the earth doe imbrace the Christian Religion, God shall be exalted and have more glory, for every King is worth ten thousand; and when one King followeth Christ, it is a greater glory to Christ, than if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people, the second book of <hi>Samuel</hi> and the eighteenth chapter, <hi>The King is to goe out and in before the People,</hi> the first book of <hi>Samuel</hi> and the eighth chapter; So the people will follow the King; if he be good they will tread in his steps. When <hi>Jothan</hi> reigned the people were good; But when <hi>Achan</hi> came, they turned with him to Idolatrie. So it fell out with <hi>Ezechiah</hi> and the people, with
<hi>Manasse</hi> and his <pb n="560" facs="tcp:62585:305"/>people, with <hi>Amon</hi> and his people, <hi>Joshuah</hi> and his people, <hi>Nobile mutatur semper cum principe vulgus:</hi> So that God is more exalted when he inclines the hearts of Kings to follow Christ, and to cleave to the Church.

<hi>David</hi> did, then will his people; but if he withdraw his liberality, they will draw away too. Hereupon Christ, when the Greeks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to see him said <hi>The hour is come that the sonne of man must be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, John</hi> the twelfth chapter.</p>
               <p>The other two wayes are as a reason, <hi>Because the shields of the earth are the Lords, his name is exalted.</hi> This was the reason that moved <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> he saw God had a power to protect and give victory, and therefore imbraced the Christian Religion. God saith to
<hi>Abraham, I am thy shield, Genesis</hi> the fifteenth chapter: And of him
<hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>He is a sheild to them that trust in him, Psalm</hi> the thirty third. <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> saw in Heaven the signes of the Crosse, on which was written, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> power to defend and give victory; therein is his name exalted. When they fee that they will take hold with the Jews and say, <hi>God is with them, Zachery</hi> the eight chapter. The other way is, because God is exalted, therefore <hi>he will defend the earth as with a shield.</hi> This is a motive to make men become religious; and when they are so, then followeth defense and safetie, which is the effect of magnifying Gods name. <hi>When we take the shield of faith, and beleeve in God, Ephesians</hi> the fift chapter, <hi>Then he will compasse us with his faith, as with a shield, Psalm</hi> the fift chapter, <hi>His faithfulnesse and truth shall be with us, and in his name shall his horne be exalted, Psalm</hi> the eighty ninth. Therefore <hi>Moses,</hi> having exalted the name of God in

               </p>
               <p>These two parts of his punishment are by good order joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; not only that the talent should be taken away, but that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be laid upon his person; that not only <hi>the tree should be cut down,</hi> and be deprived of all power to fructifie, but <hi>to be cast into the fire, Luke</hi> the thirteenth chapter; the wastfull servant must not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lose his office, but <hi>must give an account of his Stewardship, Luke</hi> the sixteenth chapter: It were well if he might only lose his talent, and himself escape, <hi>utinamperiret pecunia modo ne suo periret:</hi> but it agreeth with Gods Justice, that as the talent was lost through the negligence of the unprofitable servant; so now the servant should perish for the honor of the talent. And it stands with Gods wisdome so to punish the unprofitable servant; for <hi>if the salt be unsavery it is good for nothing but to be cast out, Matthew</hi> the fift chapter: <hi>And when the tree brings no fruit &amp; troubles the ground, it is fittest to be cut up, Luke</hi> the thirteenth chapter, that others may be planted in the room of it, that will bear fruit. Wherefore as when <hi>Saul</hi> had lost his spirit, the Kingdom tarried not long with him after; so if our talents be once taken away, we may look that God will lay a punishment upon our persons. <hi>If we fall from our first love, Apocalyps</hi> the second chapter, and use not our talents to Gods glory, we may justly fear our persons. But as God did first command <hi>Lot</hi> to goe out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> before he destroyed the Citie it self; so he will first take away the talent, that it perish not; and after the person shall be punished.</p>
               <p>The punishments inflicted upon his person, are reduced to two. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <p>Touching the first, he saith, <hi>Cast out the unprofitable servant</hi> that hath done nothing to my glorie, not <hi>servum peccatore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Luke</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, him that doth no good with the talents committed to him, <hi>sic sic in virido, Luke</hi> the twenty third chapter. If he shew such cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty towards him that was only unprofitable, and did no good; how severely will he punish those that doe hurt with their talents, that are riotous and mispend their whole talents. Three things make his punishment grievous: First, That he is punished with a separation. Secondly, It is with a violent separation. Thirdly, This separation is with disgrace and shame: For the place from which he is separated, as the Apostle saith, <hi>It doth not appear what we shall be,</hi> the first epistle
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:62585:306"/>of <hi>John</hi> and the third chapter. So it appears not to us what the place is whither we shall be gathered, if we use Gods gifts as we ought. But as he speaks of the person, so of the place: We know that it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent place, a place of such glory as <hi>the eye hath not seen,</hi> the first epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the second chapter: <hi>Such glory as all the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of this life are not to be compared with it, Romans</hi> the eighth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and therefore to be cast out from this place, will be a heavy sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p>The separation from the Temple, which was but a type of that place was so grievous to <hi>Davids</hi> soul, as he had no rest in his spirit, and thought himself in worse state than the Sparrow, <hi>till he had accesse to the Citie of God, Psalm</hi> the eighty fourth. Much more grievous is it to be separated from heaven. If of the Church on earth it is said, there are
<hi>gloriosa dict a de te, Psalm</hi> the eighty seventh. Much more glorious things are spoken of Heaven, whereof to be deprived will be a great grief; for this place hath all things which may commend any place: Of light it is said,
<hi>Lumen dilexit oculus;</hi> but this place <hi>hath no night, but continual light from the Lord himself, Apocalyps</hi> the twenty first chapter. If society doe commend a place, then this place is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, <hi>quia janua ibi aperta.</hi> If immunity from pain, <hi>there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hunger, nor thirst, nor cold.</hi> If joy, then <hi>there the elders sing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually the praises of God, Apocalyps</hi> the twenty first chapter. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be excluded from this place, which is so to be desired, is a great punishment.</p>
               <p>Again, To be separated not only from so good a place, but from such company; not only of holy Angels, where if it were a great blessing to lodge, <hi>while they were clothed with mortality, Hebrews</hi> the thirteenth chapter; then it is a greater blessing to dwell with them in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

                  </gap> but even then shall the unprofitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant be cast out from beholding the same. Secondly, That which doth aggravate his punishment is, that this separation shall be done with violence, <hi>cast him out;</hi> not bid him goe out, or lead him out. The separations that are made from the Church militant, are not done without great difficulty; no man would willingly be

                  </gap>:<pb n="563" facs="tcp:62585:306"/>But it will be a farre greater grief to be separated from the Church triumphant; but howsoever they be unwilling, yet they shall be separated violently: no man will willingly come to judgment at the last day, but <hi>God will bring every thing to judgment, Ecclesiastes</hi> the twelfth chapter; <hi>He that doth evil hates the light, John</hi> the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but we shall be brought to light whether we will or no: and death, which is a preparation to the last judgment, is fearfull: So as no man willingly dyeth, nay we make many pleas, becaule we would not be separated; we say, <hi>Lord, have not we prophecied?</hi> and yet Christ tells, <hi>all will not serve the turne, Matthew</hi> the seventh chapter; <hi>Not every one that saith Lord, Matthew</hi> the twenty fift chapter: <hi>When did we see the hungry or naked,</hi> &amp;c. But Christ for all that (we are so unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be cast out) tells us, <hi>In as much as you did it not,</hi> &amp;c. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit man will not goe out of himself, yet he shall be cast out with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which makes his punishment more grievous. Thirdly, This separation shall be with contumely and disgrace; to be thrown out of the company of the Angels, is a disgracefull separation. Many times Malefactors, though they suffer for their offences, yet have no disgrace offered them: But the unprofitable servant shall not only be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the losse of this heavenly place, but shall be <hi>cast out</hi> to his shame; for he that dishonoureth God by burying his talent bestowed upon him, God will punish him with dishonour and disgrace; <hi>Them that hate me I will hate,</hi> the first book of <hi>Samuel</hi> the second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The place into which he shall be cast, <hi>is utter darknesse.</hi> The Apostle when he saith, <hi>Ad quem ibimus?
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> habes verba aternae vitae, John</hi> the sixt chapter and the sixty eighth verse, tells us, It is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing to be in presence <hi>of them that have the words of eternall life;</hi> but it is farre more excellent to be present with eternal life it self; but not only to be deprived of his presence, but <hi>to be cast into utter darkness is extreme misery.</hi> If we might be choosers for our selves,
<hi>as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils choesed to goe into the hoggs,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> the eighth chapter and the thirty first verse: So if we might choose some place, if it were but to return to the world again, it were some mitigation; but when we have not only
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, but
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is greater cause of misery; we are not only deprived of light, but cast into a place of darknesse. And this punishment is very just, that the unprofitable servant should be cast into darknesse, which did darken his talent and hid it; as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaks of cursing, <hi>Psalm</hi> the hundred and ninth <hi>He loved not bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, then let it be farre from him;</hi> So <hi>quia non dilexit lucem, non veniat ei lux, extinguit scintilla gratiae, ne videat lumen gloriae:</hi> Which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment how grievous it is, appears, for that <hi>the beholding of light,</hi> as the Preacher saith <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> the eleventh chapter,
<hi>is so comfortable to the eyes:</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> was out of hope of recovery, when he and the rest <hi>could see nothing but darknesse, Acts</hi> the twenty seventh chapter: And God plagued the Egyptians with darknesse, as the greatest plague he could lay upon them. And the Apostle, to shew the grievous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the evil Angels, saith, <hi>They are reserved under darknesse,</hi>
                  <pb n="564" facs="tcp:62585:307"/>the second epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the second chapter; for <hi>tenebrae formido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, He is punished not only <hi>with darknesse,</hi> but also
<hi>with wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and gnashing of teeth:</hi> A man may have some comfort in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it is the best time to sleep and meditate; but the unprofitable servants being cast into darknesse, shall have neither of these comforts to mitigate his punishment. For there he shall feel the worm of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<hi>gnawing him, which shall never dye, and be tormented with the fire that never goeth out, Mark</hi> the ninth chapter: He shall have all things that may continue and increase his weeping.</p>
               <p>But in these words the Holy-Ghost pointeth out two things. The certainty, and the measure of weeping in this place.</p>
               <p>Touching the first, We see by experience, that in this life many unprofitable servants, that bury their talents, doe for all that enjoy light, and withall have great joy and gladnesse; and therefore the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghost tells them, that howsoever they escape here, yet in the world to come they shall be sure <hi>to be cast into darknesse, and to weep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually;</hi> they shall hear that <hi>Memento</hi> which the rich man received from <hi>Abraham, Luke</hi> the sixteenth chapter, <hi>Thou in thy life time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivedst pleasure, but now pain:</hi> So shall it be with the unprofitable servants, that are not diligent to imploy their talents to their Masters glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He alludes to the measure of weeping, which is found in this place; for many unprofitable servants lose their talents in this life, and are deprived of the comforts that should cheer them up; they weep and indure much sorrow: But because our weeping in this life is mixed with many comforts, which doe mitigate our grief, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost tells us, That howsoever they may finde means to delay grief and weeping here, yet the greatest weeping is behinde in the world to come, where shall be no mitigation of grief. <hi>Rachel</hi> wept and lamented much for her children, because they were not; but the weeping and lamentation of these men shall be far greater; not only because they are destitute of comfort in the midest of these miseries, but for that they shall never finde any means to mitigate their anguish and grief: Therefore as one giveth counsel, <hi>Sic legat homo histerias ne fiat historia;</hi> so, <hi>sic audite parabolam hanc ne fiat is parabola.</hi>

<hi>Malachi</hi> the third chapter and the first verse, must be fulfilled: but that also of <hi>Daniel,</hi> That being come, he should also be offered up to God, signified by that vision which the Prophet had <hi>of one like the Sonne of man, who was brought to the ancient of dayes,</hi> that was to God his Father, <hi>Daniel</hi> the seventh chapter and the thirteenth verse: Which thing was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed on the day of the Virgins Purification.

<hi>Hebrews</hi> the twelfth chapter. For the application of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it may not seem strange, but lawfull and warrantable, both by Scripture and practise of Christs Church, we are to know that it is lawfull and usual, to compare things spiritual not only with things natural, as <hi>with seed, Matthew</hi> the thirteenth chapter; with things arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, as

                     </gap>
                  </hi> the eleventh chapter and the fourth verse; and not only so, but it is usual to apply that to Christ the head, which is affirmed of the body; as where it is said of the Congregation of the Jews, <hi>Hosea</hi> the eleventh chapter, <hi>I called my sonne out of Egypt,</hi> the same is applyed to Christ the head of that body,<pb n="566" facs="tcp:62585:308"/>
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> the second chapter, <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my sonne;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as Christ the head, was truly the sonne of God, so he makes all the members of his mystical body to be sonnes. So that which God spake to a part of the body, the second book of <hi>Samuel</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter, <hi>I will be his Father,</hi> is by the Apostle applyed to Christ, <hi>the head of that body, Hebrews</hi> the first chapter and the fift verse. And so is this speech of
<hi>Hanna,</hi> in offering her sonne to God, applyed by the ancient Church to the oblation of Christ in the Temple, as those were of the Prophet,
<hi>Lamentations</hi> the first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the twelfth verse, to the sacrifice of his passion. So this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is warrantable. For if
<hi>Hannah</hi> did offer to God <hi>Samuel</hi> her sonne, much more ought the Virgin to offer up Christ in token of thankfulnesse, who is a greater than
<hi>Samuel,</hi> as <hi>he was greater than Salomon, Matthew</hi> the twelfth chapter. This composition is fit, and hath congruity both in respect of the mothers, their songs being compared together, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. <hi>Luke</hi>
1. which in effect are all one, and for the persons of the children, for they were both Nazarites, verse eleven, <hi>Luke</hi> the second chapter, <hi>He shall be called a Nazarite.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Though there have been some that were both Prophet and Priest, or King and Prophet; yet all three, Priest, Prophet, and Prince, did not concurre in any but in <hi>Samuel,</hi> who therefore was a representation of Christ, annointed by God, Prophet, Priest, and King. Thirdly, <hi>Samuels</hi> love to his enemies, for whom he ceased not to pray, the first book of <hi>Samuel</hi> and the twelfth chapter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth Christs love, who prayed for his persecutors, <hi>Luke</hi> the twenty third chapter, <hi>father forgive them;</hi> which love Christ also shewed, in that
<hi>when we were enemies he reconciled us to God, Romans</hi> the fift chapter. In respect of which resemblance, <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior est compositio quam positio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In those words we have to consider two donations; First, Gods giving to <hi>Hannah,</hi> vers. the twenty seventh. Secondly, <hi>Hannahs</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving back again to God, verse the twenty eighth. As the first dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion begins with prayer, and ends with gift; so the latter begins gift, and ends with prayer. And it is agreeable to reason, that the child which came by intercession, should end with intercession.</p>
               <p>Concerning which donations we are to note joyntly, First, That we can give nothing to God, but we must first receive it from him; As
<hi>Hannah</hi> could not offer her child to the Lord, unlesse she first had received him from the Lord: For so saith King <hi>David,</hi> the first book of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> the twenty ninth chapter and the fourteenth verse,
<hi>Quae de manu tua accepimus, damus tibi.</hi> Secondly, When we have received any blessing from God, then we must give to him as we are exhorted,
<hi>Psalm</hi> the seventy sixt and the eleventh verse, and <hi>Psalm</hi> the ninety sixt &amp; the eighth verse, <hi>Bring present; and joy into his Courts.</hi>

               <p>Prayer is compared to a Key, wherewith, as <hi>Elias opened the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, when they were shut up, Luke</hi> the fourth chapter and the twenty fift verse.

<hi>Philippians</hi> the second chapter, of the faith and obedience we owe to him. Therefore, as we have offended <hi>per ablationem;</hi> so must we satisfie <hi>per oblationem;</hi> as <hi>Jacob,</hi> having robbed
<hi>Esau</hi> of his birthrigh, by taking his blessing from him, doth satisfie and appease his wrath by offering to him; that is the ground and reason of our gift. But if we will appease by a gift there must be an equality; we may not offer a thing under the value of the thing which wastaken away; that is the reason why all the sacrifices of the Law could not appease God, as the Apostle sheweth, <hi>It is impossible that the blood of Bulls and Goats should take away sinnes, Hebrews</hi> the tenth chapter, and <hi>Psalm</hi> the fourtieth; therefore the Prophet saith, <hi>Wherewith shall I come and appear before God? shall I bring Rams and Sheep, or Rivers of Oyle? shall I give my first borne? Michah</hi> the sixt chapter. But all that will not satisfie God, for that we have taken from him. The value of our obedience to God is such as cannot appease and satisfie his Majestie, being offended, The soul is more precious than all the world; and no sufficient ransom can be given by man for it,
<hi>Matthew</hi> the sixteenth chapter: But if we can offer to God a thing of equall price to the obedience which we owe to God, then no doubt but he will be appeased, especially if we offer a thing of a higher rate: But Christ is of greater value than all that we can take from God; for howsoever the sinne be great, in that we that are but men, should sinne against God who is infinite: yet if we look to Christs person, who hath satisfied for us, it is of such dignity as doth worthily serve for a ransom for the sinnes of all the world. And for our concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, the love of Christ hath made a sufficient satisfaction for it; which love is such as the Apostle calleth it,

<hi>Mercie and Judgment, Psalm</hi> the hundred and first, of our selves we are to rely upon Gods mercy in Christ: But in as much as Christ in our persons hath so fully satisfied for us, we may be bold to tell his Justice now, <hi>That his righteousnesse is made ours,</hi> and <hi>we are made the righteousnesse of God in him,</hi> the second epistle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> the fift chapter.</p>

<hi>Adams</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racise, but this is called Gods Paradise; the other was a Paradise on earth, but this a celestial Paradise, that into which the Apostle was caught up, in the second epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the twelfth chapter, which he himself saith, <hi>was the third Heaven:</hi> the Paradise which Christ here promiseth is that wherein he himself is a Paradise of all joyes and happinesse; of which he saith, <hi>Father I will that they be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, John</hi> the seventeenth chapter and the twenty fourth verse: For as God himself is a spirit, so his joy and happinesse is spiritual; and the place wherein he is, is a spiritual Paradise: Such joy was that he speaks of, <hi>Matthew</hi> the twenty fift chapter,
<hi>Intra in gaudium Domini.</hi> So are we to think <hi>the throne of God the Father where Christ sitteth, Apocalyps</hi> the third chapter and the twenty first verse, that it is the heavenly joy and glory which he enjoyeth in heaven: So saith the Wise man, <hi>Proverbs</hi> the thirteenth chapter, that there is ordained this tree of life, wherein we have the accomplishment of all our desires, which is no where but in Heaven, where God is all in all.</p>
               <p>For <hi>the tree of life,</hi> which Christ promiseth <hi>to him that overcommeth,</hi> It is another manner of tree than that in the garden of
<hi>Eden:</hi> That was a natural tree appointed to preserve <hi>Adams</hi> natural life, but this a is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual tree, and preserveth supernatnral life: And albeit Man being debarred of this natural tree in the Garden, dyeth a bodily death; yet this tree in the Paradise of God keeps us, from being hurt
<hi>of the second death, Apocalyps</hi> the second chapter and the eleventh verse. Christ himself saith of himself, <hi>I am alive, but I was dead, and behold I live for evermore, Apocalyps</hi> the first chapter and the eighteenth verse; that is, he lost the natural life, but now he lives a supernatural life: and so shall all his members that eate of the tree of life which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth.</p>
               <p>Well is the state of our death and rising again, shadowed out by a tree; for as <hi>Job</hi> speaks, <hi>Job</hi> the fourteenth chapter,
<hi>There is hope of a tree, that though it be cut down, yet it will sprout out and the branches thereof will shoot forth;</hi> So though we dye a bodily death, yet there is hope that we shall rise again, and live a supernaturall life, which we obtain by eating of this tree of life: The center of our desire is the tree of life, the circumference is Paradise wherein we have promised us, not only <hi>coronam vitae, Apocalyps</hi> the second chapter 10. <hi>But the crown of glory,</hi> the first of <hi>Peter</hi> and the fift chapter; <hi>And the crown of joy and happinesse,</hi> the first of the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> the second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the nineteenth verse, <hi>We shall have our saciety of pleasure, and whatsoever mans heart can desire; for we shall be in the presence of God, whose right hand is pleasure for ever, Psalm</hi> 16.</p>

                  </note>Secondly, The seed of the Serpent is without us; for there are <hi>filii Belial,</hi> of whom were those to whom Christ said, <hi>John</hi> the eight chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>You are of your Father the Devil:</hi> Such as will doe mischief for doing well, such enemies <hi>are men of corrupt mindes and understandings that are destitute of the truth, and are bold to say that gain is godlinesse, from which we must separate our selves,</hi> the first epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> the sixt chapter and the fift verse. And if we overcome in this warre, then we shall be partakers of this promise. But who overcommeth in this warre? and who can say, he is a conqueror in this battall? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, <hi>That he that sinneth is overcome of sinne, and brought into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the sinne,</hi> the second epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the second chapter and the nineteenth verse: Therefore where the promise is here made only to him that overcommeth, we must see if the Scripture offereth more graces, <hi>James</hi> the fourth chapter and the sixt verse: And if we look into <hi>Apocalyps</hi> the second chapter and the fift verse, we shall finde there he that makes this promise offers more graces, that is, <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen and repent, and doe thy first works.</hi>

Men may draw neer to the holy mysterie of Christs body and blood, and snatch at the tree of life; but Christ gives it not, except they be such as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, either by the grace of abstinencie from sinne, or of repentance and sorrow for sinne: They may be partakers of the tree of life <hi>de

               <p>So both the promise and condition are touched: But the question is, How we shall overcome? that we learn, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> the twelfth chapter; where the Saints are said <hi>to overcome the great dragon, the old Serpent, with the blood of the Lambe:</hi> Which blood hath two uses. First, that which the Apostle calls <hi>the sprinkling of the blood of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Christ,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the first chapter and the second verse. Secondly, That by receiving <hi>the cup of blessing we are partakers of the blood of Christ,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the tenth chapter and the sixteenth verse. So that in these words is a reciprocation, <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centi ut comedat, &amp; comedenti ut vincat, dabo edere;</hi> the body and blood of Christ is the fruit of that tree of life which the Apostle speaks of, the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the second chapter and the twenty fourth verse,
<hi>That he bare our sinnes in his body upon the tree;</hi> Of which fruit whosoever are partakers in the Sacrament, when it is ministred to them, doe receive power to overcome, that so they may eate of the tree of eternal life: For in this Sacrament we have both a means of victory and a pledge of our reward, that is, the life of grace begun in us here, to assure us of a glorious life in the world to come. Every tree must have a root, and the root of that tree which Christ speaks of is here in this Sacrament; for in it is sown in the hearts of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as it were, a kernel, which in time shoots forth and becomes a tree; for as there was a death of the soul by sinne, before God infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted<pb n="577" facs="tcp:62585:313"/>a death of the body; so answerable to that first death of sinne, there must be in us a life of grace, which is the root of that tree from whence we shall, in due time, receive the life of glory.</p>
               <p>In this sacrament the tree of the life of Grace is town in us, that is, a measure of grace wrought in our hearts by the power of Gods spirit, by which we shall at length attain to eate of that tree which shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey unto us the life of glory. As there are two trees of life; so we must have a double Paradise: We must have liberty to be of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise on earth, that is, the Church Militant, which is called <hi>hortus conclusus, Canticles</hi> the second chapter, before we can be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heavenly Paradise, that is, the Church Triumphant. So there is a plain analogie between those. As <hi>when we are dead in sinnes and in the uncircumcision of the flesh, Colossians</hi> the second chapter and the thirteenth verse, we receive the life of grace by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ in baptism; so when we are fallen from the life of grace and <hi>are restrained from the life of God, Ephesians</hi> the fourth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and eighteenth verse, <hi>and dead in trespasses and sinnes, Ephesians</hi> the second chapter, then we obtain victory against sinne and death <hi>by the blood of the Lamb,</hi> being drunk in the Sacrament,
<hi>Apocalyps</hi> the twelfth chapter and the eleventh verse. For if the material tree of life in Paradise received such influence from God,
<hi>Genesis</hi> the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that being dead in it felse, it had power to convey the natural life of our Parents, while they eat of the fruit thereof, then is God able as well to give such a power to the Creatures of Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, that albeit they are dead of themselves, to convey into us the life of grace, even as the tree of life did prolong natural life; for so saith Christ, <hi>John</hi> the sixth chapter and the fifty third verse,
<hi>Except ye eat the flesh of the sonne of man, and drink his blood, ye have no lifein you. Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; he that eateth me shall live by me;</hi> And he that

                  </hi> the thirtieth chapter, <hi>ipse enim est vita mea,</hi> and he committeth life to the sonne: Therefore it is said, <hi>There is a River of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb, Apocalyps</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

God being the fountain of life, draws life to his sonne, as into a Cistern, from whence we draw life; therefore it is said of the wisdome of God, that is Christ, that he is <hi>a tree of life, Proverbs</hi> the third chapter and the eighteenth verse; of whom it is now said, <hi>in ipso er at vita, John</hi> the fourteenth chapter; and therefore he calls himself <hi>this life, John</hi> the fourteenth chapter. This is the Cistern of life, to give life to them that are dead in original sinne, by the sprinkling of his blood in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In this <pb n="578" facs="tcp:62585:314"/>Sacrament Christ hath provided a tree of life of graces against the death of sinne, whereof they must be partakers that will eat of the tree of life, which Christ here promiseth: So that whereas the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man saith, <hi>Fructus justi est lignum vitae, Proverbs</hi> the eleventh chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the thirtieth verse. The seed of this tree is here sown, and bringeth forth the root of a better tree; for as grace is the root of glory, so glory is the fruit of grace. Here in this life the root of grace is planted in us, and brings forth the fruits of righteousnesse, that in the life to come it may make us partakers of the tree of glory; and to assure us of this life, <hi>we are sealed with the holy spirit of promise, as the earnest of our inheritance, Ephesians</hi> the first chapter and the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse, and the second epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the twenty second verse: That albeit we are fallen and can be overcome of finne, yet if we fight better <hi>and doe the first works,</hi> we shall be partakers of the life of glory: The kernel of grace is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in us by the participation of the body and blood of Christ; of which kernel commeth a tree, which bringeth forth the fruits of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and righteousnes in our whole life: Which God will in due time reward with the Crown of life and glory in the world to come.</p>

Now the crown of our rejoycing is the summe of our desire: and therefore as there
<hi>Deborah</hi> desireth to have the promptnesse and readinesse continued in the people; so the Apostle wisheth that all the Hebrews, as they have been carefull to practise the fruits of faith, so should they still shew further diligence in that behalf.

                     </gap>, speremus;</hi> therefore the Apostle saith, the end of all Scripture is, <hi>that we may have hope, Romans</hi> the fifteenth chapter and the fourth verse; and that which he affirmeth, in the first epistle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> the ninth chapter,
<hi>That he which planteth, planteth in hope,</hi> is<pb n="579" facs="tcp:62585:314"/>as much true in all actions: the ground whereof is the hope we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of some benefit; for he that soweth, soweth in hope, he that sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, saileth in hope and he that marrieth, doth it in hope that his estate will be bettered thereby: For sure it is, that it is but a comfortlesse thing to beleeve that there is everlasting joy and glory laid up in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, except a man be perswaded that he shall be partaker of it; <hi>Exan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis res fides sine spe, quia spes fidei exanguis est, Amb.</hi> And as hope is the blood of faith, as the Prophet saith, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the thirtieth chapter and the fifteenth verse, <hi>In quietnesse and in confidence shall be your strength;</hi> so hope is that which whets diligence: and therefore the Prophet saith, in the second book of the
<hi>Chronicles</hi> the fifteenth chapter and the seventeenth verse, <hi>Be strong and let not your hands be weak, for your work shall have an end:</hi> And in the new Testament the Apostle saith, <hi>Be stedfast and immovable, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord, Quod labor vester non erit inanis in Domino,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the fifteenth chapter and the fifty eighth verse. So nothing is more to be desired than to have hope in the evil day; and the means of this hope is to shew forth diligence.</p>
               <p>But for the easier intreatie of the contents of this verse, the points which the Apostle holdeth are, first, That we are not only to beleeve, but also to hope: Secondly, Not with a feeble or faint hope, but with the fulnesse of hope: Thirdly, This hope must not be for an hour, as Christ speaketh of <hi>St. John, John</hi> the fift chapter, but continuing to the end.</p>
               <p>Then for the means of this hope his request is, First, That Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence be used: Secondly, This Diligence must be shewed forth.</p>
               <p>For the first point, the Apostles desire is, That they should hope for that which they beleeve; wherein standeth the real difference that is between the faith of the Devils and men reprobate, and the faith of the Children of God; for even to the Devils the Apostle ascribes faith, but this faith ends in fear, <hi>James</hi> the second chapter, <hi>Damones credunt &amp; contremiscunt;</hi> but a Christian mans faith and belees ends in hope. A Christian man beleeves that he may have hope, for hope comes by faith, as the Apostle sheweth, <hi>Galatians</hi> the fift chapter and the fift verse, <hi>We by the spirit wait for the hope of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse through faith; and that faith which is the cause of hope, doth work by love;</hi> as the same Apostle
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>And love causeth dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Credendo speramus, sperando diligimus, qui diligit diligendus est, Amb</hi> For there is no love without diligence. And so necessary is hope that the Apostle makes it a part of our salvation: For as, <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> the second chapter, <hi>ye are saved by faith;</hi> so he saith, <hi>Romans</hi> the eighth chapter and the twenty fourth verse, <hi>we are saved by hope:</hi> For howsoever it is certain, that God is the hope of all men in general, as the Prophet calls him, <hi>the hope of all the ends of the earth,</hi> and <hi>of them that are in the broad sea, Psalm</hi> the sixty fift; so it is as certain, there is another hope, besides that general, which the faithfull conceive; for that general hope concerns this present life. The Apostle saith, if we had no other hope but that, <hi>we are of all men most miserable,</hi> the
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:62585:315"/>first to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the fifteenth chapter. The hope of all men is, <hi>spes Dei,</hi> that he doth save both man and beast, <hi>Psalm</hi> 36. that they shall be delivered from outward danger, and shall be both kept by God under the shadow of his wings; and when none can minister help, then they, flying to God, shall be safe: But he is more specially called <hi>the hope of Israel, Joel</hi> the third chapter and the sixteenth verse; that is, there is a further hope, &amp; this is a Christians hope. It is true that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians have a hope in God for defence from trouble in this life, as others have: and in that sense, this their hope <hi>is like a brest-plate against the troubles of this life,</hi> the first epistle to the
<hi>Thessalonians</hi> the fift chapter and the eighth verse; and the same hope of theirs, for that the troubles of this life are compared to the surges and waves of the Sea, is called <hi>an Anchor, Hebrews</hi> the sixt chapter. But the Christian mans hope goeth further than that general hope; for the Heathen doth say, <hi>spero dum spiro;</hi> but when breath is gone, <hi>the just man hath hope in his death, Justus etiam in morte sperat, Proverbs</hi> the fourteenth chapter and the twenty third verse: therefore the Apostle calls a Christian mans hope <hi>spem vivam, a lively hope;</hi> as if the other were
<hi>spes mortua,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the first chapter and the third verse: For whereas the faith of all men doth fail in death, the Christians faith doth even then flourish, because <hi>they are begotten again to a lively hope, through the resurrection of Christ from the dead.</hi> It was
<hi>Davids</hi> speech, <hi>That when he was laid in the grave, his flesh should rest in hope, Psalm</hi> the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth. In this life our hope hath a waiting, as <hi>St. Paul</hi> calls it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it doth hope for the hope of righteousnesse by Christ, <hi>Galatians</hi> the fift chapter and the fift verse; and after this life it hopes for <hi>the fruition of the riches of glory,</hi> that is, <hi>for Christ himself, who is the hope of glory, Colossians</hi> the first chapter and the twenty seventh verse: His hope is not in the shadow of Gods wings only, but <hi>spes in lumine virtutis,</hi> as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Psalme</hi> the eighty ninth and the fifteenth verse.</p>
               <p>There is yet one point more, and that is a necessary admonition not to confound, but keep several these two virtues theological; for they be two dis-joyned virtues, as the Apostle sheweth, the first epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> the thirteenth chapter: Now these three are <hi>Faith, Hope, and Love;</hi> and whereas we put Hope under Faith, all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers have put difference between them; of whom <hi>Augustine</hi> makes four differences: First, Faith hath for its object the word and promise of God, but Hope looks not for a promise, but <hi>rem promissam,</hi> we beleeved the promise, but hope for the thing promised. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of Faith, as well evil things as good things, are the object; for we beleeve the pains of Hell no lesse than the joyes of Heaven, but the object of our hope is only for good things, as <hi>that in this life we shall be partakers of the righteousnesse of Christ, and afterward of his glory.</hi> Thirdly, We doe not only beleeve things to come, but such as are present and past; for things past by faith we apprehend, <hi>Hebrexs</hi> the eleventh chapter and third verse; and for things to come, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve there shall be a day of Judgement, <hi>when the Shepheard shall</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For the use of this virtue, whereas in the Scripture there are many sayings which force farre, As that, <hi>as the ground that drinks in rain and bringeth not forth grasse, is cursed;</hi> so the Christian that drinks the water of Gods word, and yet brings forth no fruits of faith is in a cursed state, <hi>Hebrews</hi> the sixt chapter: Yet to conceive hope, because in the same chapter is matter of comfort also, so the Apostle saith, <hi>That by two immutable things, whereby it is impossible for God to lye,</hi> that is his word and oath, <hi>we have strong consolation, Hebrews</hi> the sixt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the eighteenth verse: As <hi>he hath made us great and pretious promises,</hi> the second epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the second chapter; so
<hi>he is a faithfull Creator,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the fourth chapter: And as <hi>Sarah</hi> confessed, <hi>He is faithfull that hath promised, Hebrews</hi> the eleventh chapter and the eleventh verse: And as
<hi>Sarah</hi> said, so <hi>Abraham</hi> saith, <hi>He is able to doe what he promiseth, Romans</hi> the fourth chapter &amp; the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty first verse. And therefore we are to conceive hope, and say with the Apostle, in the second epistle to <hi>Timothie</hi> the first chapter, <hi>I know whom I have beleeved, Scio cuicredidi;</hi> and not only able, but willing, <hi>For of them that come to him he casteth away none, John</hi> the sixt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Our hope must not be faint, but we must have a perfect assurance of hope; not a hope halfe full, but the full measure of hope, as the Apostle sheweth, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

This is <hi>Peters</hi> desire, as it is the Apostles

<hi>Etenim si occiderit, sperabo in eum;</hi> Which made <hi>Paul</hi> say
<hi>Romans</hi> the eighth chapter and the thirty eighth verse, <hi>I am sure that neither life nor death, things present, nor to come</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This fulnesse of hope must continue to the end, and not abide for a time: As Christ blames, <hi>Luke</hi> the eighth chapter,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, so the Apostle finds fault with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary hope: It is that which we see in <hi>Demas,</hi> he beleeved and had hope, and gave great hope for a time, so that <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledged him his fellow laborer; but his faith and hope had soon an end, for he for look
<hi>Paul, and fell to embracing the present world,</hi> the second epistle to
<hi>Timothie</hi> the fourth chapter. Therefore it is not enough to hope for a time, but our hope must continue to the end; for as the Apostle saith, thou mayst see the goodnesse of God <hi>in breaking off the natural branches to graff thee in, if thou continue;</hi> for else he will shew like se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to thee, <hi>Romans</hi> the eleventh chapter and the seventeenth verse; but thou must <hi>permanere.</hi> The same Apostle saith, <hi>Galatians</hi> the fift chapter and the seventh verse, <hi>You did run well</hi> as if he should say, nay you fate still, and therefore all is to no purpose: Therefore the Apostle exhorts, <hi>So to run that they may obtain,</hi> the first to the
<hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> the ninth chapter; as he himself doth in chastising his body and subduing it, least while he preach to them, he should be rejected. His meaning is, albeit he be assured, <hi>That nothing shall separate him from the love of God, Romans</hi> the eighth chapter and the thirty eighth verse, yet he will runne still, and keep his hope. For the state

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> is like the fanctifying of the Nazarite, <hi>If at the end of six dayes he did touch any unclean thing, he was to begin again, Numbers</hi> the sixt chapter and the twelfth verse. So it is in the matter of hope and other virtues: And therefore the Prophet prayeth not only for the spirit and an ingenious spirit, but <hi>a constant spirit that may continue, Psalm</hi> the fifty first.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="583" facs="tcp:62585:316"/>The means are set down in these words, First, he would have them use Diligence: Secondly, it must be demonstrative and expert Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: Thridly, it must be the same Diligence that is shewed in the works of Love and Charity, and in the distribution to the poor.</p>
               <p>Of these three points the first is, The Apostle

                  </gap> we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our selves in our hope: He that said, <hi>I shall never be moved, Psalm</hi> the thirtieth and and the sixt verse, had hope enough and too much; and he that said,
<hi>Though all men for sake thee, yet not I, Matthew</hi> the twenty sixt chapter, hoped enough and too much: and therefore hope doth well in injoyning the means; for as in the beginning of the chapter, verse the sixt, is matter of feare, and in the end, verse the eighteenth, matter of hope; so here he willeth them to shew dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that this hope may appear, and that it be not a negligent and sluggish hope, as he speaks, <hi>ut ne fit is semper sperantes:</hi> For as fear, if it be not mixed with hope, doth degenerate into desperation; so hope, if it be not tempered with fear, will turn to presumption. And it was the case of these two Saints, <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Peter,</hi> and we see what came of it: And therefore of <hi>Job,</hi> who had such an assured hope in God, even in death, it is said, <hi>Nonne timor tuus spes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>Peter,</hi> the first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the thirteenth verse, saith after, verse the seventeenth, <hi>Passe your time in fear:</hi> He that before called for a perfection of hope, doth here require fear; for so our hope may not fall asleep or wax negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.

<hi>Ostende mihi fidem ex operibus, James</hi> the second chapter and eighth verse: So the Apostles meaning is, I care not for the concealed diligence, let me see it appear by your outward conversation.

<hi>Apocalyps</hi> the twenty second chapter and the ninth verse; so on the other side, it is not a Religion of Saduces, <hi>that hold there is no Angels nor spirit, Acts</hi> the twenty third chapter and the eighth verse; but it doth acknowledge that such blessed spirits there be, and that God hath erected a ladder that reacheth up to Heaven, by which the Angels of God goe up and down to convey Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings to men, <hi>Genesis</hi> the twenty eighth chapter: And therefore by all means it opposeth it self against the opinion of those that seek to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this ladder, as if there were no duty to be performed by them towards us: For, in thankfulnesse to God for this benefit, that the Angels have a care of us, the Church have thought it good, weighing both the one extremity of superstition, which <hi>Moses</hi> compareth to drunkennesse, and the other extremity of prophanenesse, which he likeneth to thirst,
<hi>Deuteronomie</hi> the twenty ninth chapter and the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse, to keep this Feast.</p>
               <p>And indeed if we consider, that those glorious spirits who have the continual fruition of Gods presence, <hi>Matthew</hi> the eighteenth chapter and the tenth verse, <hi>In whose presence is the fulnesse of all jay, Psalm</hi> the sixteenth, can be content to abandon that place of this felicity, to come down and perform duties to the sonnes of men, namely, <hi>to take charge of us and keep us from danger, Psalm</hi> the ninetie first and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth verse, <hi>to be as ministring spirits,</hi> for their sakes <hi>that shall be heirs of salvation, Hebrews</hi> the first chapter: This cannot but be reckoned a special favour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Especially if we goe a degree further, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that they leave their assistance in Gods presence, where is all glorie and happinesse, to Minister to us that dwell in houses of clay, <hi>Job</hi> the fourth chapter, and that for our nobility, must derive our selves into corruption and worms, <hi>Job</hi> the seventeenth chapter and the fourteenth verse, that such holy spirits should come down upon such sinfull spirits, such glorious spirits should Minister to such vile bodies, this gives us further cause to remember this benefit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The manner of this Ministry may be a special motive to stir us up to thankfulnesse: This ministry and service done to us is as farre as any can reach, that is, <hi>usque ad consilium fideli &amp; auxilium.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Touching the persons that waged this battail, they are on the one side <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels: On the other side the Dragon and his Angels.</p>
               <p>Wherein the first thing is, what we must conceive concerning
<hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael.</hi> It is sure the Church of God, upon many and weighty reasons, doth not favour the opinion of those that make Christ to be <hi>Michael: Michael, Daniel</hi> the tenth chapter and the thirteenth verse, <hi>is said to be one of the first Princes or Rulers,</hi> which is to be understood of some principal Angel, and not of Christ, who is set up above all Princes, and is not to be reckoned among them, <hi>being the Prince of Princes, and Lord of Lords:</hi> And the Annotation of those that hold this opinion sheweth that there is an Angel under Christ, which takes charge for the defense of the Church on earth, which is <hi>Michael your Prince, Dan.</hi> 10. 21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Out of <hi>Judes</hi> epistle verse the ninth, the ancient Fathers prove, that by <hi>Michael</hi> we are not to understand Christ; for that which he affirmeth, <hi>that Michael durst not check the Devill with cursed speaking,</hi> cannot be ascribed to Christ, which not only dare, but <hi>hath trodden down Satan under his feet;</hi> much more dare he check him: which unlesse he could doe, it were a plain signe that he is not Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent. Therefore by <hi>Michael</hi> here we are to understand some other and not Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Out of this place, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> the twelfth chapter and the fift verse, In as much as the Child that was born was Christ, it is not like that this Childe should suddenly be translated into an Archangel and fight with the Dragon. And therefore both <hi>Theodoret</hi> and others say, that <hi>Michael</hi> is a chief spirit among the created spirits that then took care of the Church in <hi>Jury,</hi> and still is carefull of Christs Church unto the end of the world. And to this we may add the judgement of the Church, which on this holy-day doth thank God for the service of the Angels, but makes no mention of Christ, that it is he that in this place warreth with the Dragon and his Angels. For the Dragon there is a farre more easie passage; so as we may soon guesse what is meant by him; for in this chapter he is called the Devil and Satan, whereof their name signifieth a slanderer; and he is justly so called, for that he both slandereth God to man, as if God did envy mans prosperity, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis</hi> the third chapter, and slanders man to God, as he did <hi>Job,</hi> whom albeit he were a blessed Saint, yet he accuseth before God as an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, <hi>Job</hi> the first chapter. The other name Satan signifieth a great enemie, not only to the good, whom he hath most cause to hate, as being contrary to him, but also to the bad. That he is an enemy to the good, it appears by this, That he persecuted not only the child that was new born, but the woman also, and because he cannot shew his malice upon him,
<hi>he makes warre with her seed, Apocalyps</hi> the twelfth chapter the thirteenth &amp; seventeenth verses. That he persecuted also an enemie to the bad, appears verse the ninth, where he is called, <hi>The seducer of</hi>
                  <pb n="589" facs="tcp:62585:319"/>
                  <hi>of the whole world, and the accuser of the brethren,</hi> for that he first brings them to commit grievous sinnes, and then pleads against them, that the plague of God may come upon them.</p>
               <p>These are the Leaders: The Bands and Souldiers under their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct are Angels on both sides.</p>
               <p>The Angels that serve under <hi>Michael</hi> are <hi>they that excell in strength and doe the command of God in obeying the voice of his word, Psalm</hi> the hundred and third and the twentieth verse, they that the Apostle calls <hi>elect Angels,</hi> the first epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> the fift chapter and the twenty first verse.</p>
               <p>The Angels that warre on the Dragons side, are <hi>the evil Angels, Psalm</hi> the seventy eighth and the fourty ninth verse; <hi>The Angels that sinned,</hi> the second epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the second chapter, And <hi>they that kept not their original,</hi> as <hi>Jude</hi> saith: these fight for the Dragon, and he is their Captain; as Christ saith,
<hi>The Prince of the Devils is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Matthew</hi> the twelfth chapter. For as among the good Angels there is <hi>principatus, &amp; primus principatus;</hi> so it is among the wicked Angels, for there must be order in all companies.</p>
               <p>Touching the Battail it self, we are first to remove some things of offence, not to think it strange that the Angels are here said to move battail. For albeit they be called <hi>Angeli pacis, Isaiah</hi> the thirty third chapter and the seventh verse, because they bring peace; yet in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places they are called <hi>Gods Hosts;</hi> as <hi>Jacob seeing the Angels of God, called the place where they were Nahanaim, Genesis</hi> the thirty second chapter and the second verse; and they magnisie God by that title,
<hi>Isaiah</hi> the sixt chapter, <hi>Lord God of Hosts: Luke</hi> the second chapter, the Angels are called <hi>Heavenly Souldiers:</hi> And where Christ saith, <hi>If I pray to the Father, he will give me more than twelve
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of Angels, Matthew</hi> the twenty sixt chapter. He compareth them to Troops and Bands of Souldiers, for that they are not only Angels to Gods friends and servants, but souldiers fighting against them that oppose themselves against God. Further, where their state is in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual motion, that must not offend us; for the Angels themselves are not yet in the perfection of their felicity; for we see they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in doing service for us; they continually aseend and descend from Heaven to Earth, and from Earth to Heaven; for the good of the godly; for God saw it good, that as well they, as the Saints departed out of this life,
<hi>should not be made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Hebrews</hi> the eleventh chapter and the fourtieth verse; which is illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated <hi>Matthew</hi> the thirteenth chapter, where the Angels are called <hi>Reapers,</hi> giving us to understand thereby, that as the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not at rest till the Harvest be all in; so it is with the Angels, they must continually be imployed in doing service for them that shall inherit Salvation, till the number of the Elect be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.</p>
               <p>So neither needs that to offend any, that the Dragon is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to have fought in Heaven; for so he is said <hi>to have appeared before God among the sonnes of God:</hi> And when <hi>Ahab</hi> was to be deceived, <hi>a lying spirit</hi>
                  <pb n="590" facs="tcp:62585:320"/>
                  <hi>stood before God,</hi> the first book of the
<hi>Kings</hi> the twenty second chapter. All this was only by Gods permission. For all this doth no make the Devil blessed, no more than <hi>Adam</hi> was blessed being in paradise: For having sinned, and being thereby out of Gods favour, he no more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed that comfort of Paradise which he took before his fall, but qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and hid himself from the presence of God for tear,
<hi>Genesis</hi> the third chapter. The Dragon is no more blessed for being in Heaven, or appearing before God, than a prisoner, that for a time is brought out of prison into the Court to be arraigned; for he takes no delight of the pomp and glorie of the Court, knowing it is not for him, but he must return to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>These offences being removed, we come now to the Fight it self, which was not in any bodily manner, <hi>for they are spirits,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

These Combats and spiritual Battails were more grievous to <hi>David,</hi> than those which he fought with the Philistims, with <hi>Saul,</hi> or any other outward enemies whatsoever.</p>
               <p>The Battails fought between these two parties are in Scripture four.</p>
               <p>The first is that which in the beginning was fought between them, that when the one said, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the fourteenth chapter and the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse, <hi>ascendam,</hi> the other went down; when the one said, I will sit, they said he should stand, <hi>Daniel</hi> the seventh chapter; when the Dragon said <hi>I will be like the most high,</hi> the other said
<hi>Michael who is like God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is that which <hi>Jude</hi> speaketh of, that there was a conflict between <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel and the Devil, about the doad body of <hi>Moses,</hi> verse 9.</p>
               <p>The third is mentioned in <hi>Daniel</hi> the tenth chapter the thirteenth verse, where when the Church was in thraldom and captivity under the Persians and Chaldeans, the Dragon would have kept them still in bondage, but

               <p>The fourth Batrail is that which is here fought by

And as the Angels offer fight for the one, so will they for the other: For it is plain, that the Angels are first in arms when any injury is offered either to the Child, or the Woman, or to her seed.</p>
               <p>What this Battail was between the Dragon and the Child the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church is, That albeit the Devils by their creation were glorious Angels, yet they might be content not to presume so farre <hi>as to be like the most high,</hi> but <hi>after the manifold wisdome of God was made known by the Church unto principalities and powers, Ephesians</hi> the third chapter and the tenth verse; that is, when they saw it was Gods will, that the Child born of our flesh and taken out of the earth, was taken up into Heaven, to the throne of God: This was it that stirred them up to battail. For howsoever they be constrained to submit themselves to God, yet they cannot abide to honour a peece of clay: And albeit they could not be equal with God, yet they would retain a superiority above men: which thing being not granted them, they are incensed against Christ: They think it a great indignity, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have done service to men <hi>tanquam Domini,</hi> as things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Lord, that now they should doe service to men <hi>tanquam Domino.</hi> But this they are inforced to perform to Christ who is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in his Humanity; and in as much as Christ hath taken our nature, they must adore our nature. This is that which the Dragon and his Angels would not yeeld unto: But they prevail not in this fight. Again, the consideration of this which the Apostle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As also that which the Apostle affirms, the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the sixt chapter and the third vorse, That the nature of man shall judge Angels: this might greatly offend them. And the Dragon and his Angels will no doubt suggest these thoughts into <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels; but yet they

                  </gap> any indignity. And seeing the Angels are such honourable spirits, they must needs take it very ill, that not only mans nature is exalted above theirs, but that they mult doe service unto men; not as things pertaining to the Lord, but as to the Lord himself. This must<pb n="592" facs="tcp:62585:321"/>needs offend them, That when they sinne, they finde no favour; but if man sinne, he is spared: That when the Sonne of God doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest himself to the world, he doth not vouchsafe the Angels so much honour as to assume their nature, <hi>but takes the seed of Abraham;</hi> and that he will in the last time make men judges of Angels. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner did the Dragon and his Angels oppose themselves against <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels; but we see how he doth resist all these temptations and assaults: and therefore this battail is worthy to be kept in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
               <p>The Conquest followeth. Wherein we see, that in steed of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, that they should not look at the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of Christs Incarnation, we see the Angels are content

<hi>Peter</hi> the first chapter, the eleventh and twelfth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>to stoop down to look into those things that concern Christ.</hi> Whereas they were perswaded to turn their backs on Christ, we see <hi>they all fall down and worship him, Hebrews</hi> the first chapter and sixt verse: They all acknowledge <hi>Worthy is the Lamb to receive power, riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and glory, and majesty: praise, and honor, and glorie to him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb for evermore, Apocalyps</hi> the fift chapter, the twelfth and thirteenth verses: And instead of exalting themselves, they are ready to offer battail to them that perswade them hereunto; as <hi>Davids</hi> heart was more inclined to <hi>Joab,</hi> than his wicked sonne
<hi>Absolom;</hi> which made him make <hi>Joab</hi> a means for his restoring into his fathers favour: So God is more inclined to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to men that sinne, than to Angels; and that is it that makes the Angels submit themselves to the nature of men. So that they see Christ vouchsafeth to call us
<hi>Bretheren, Matthew</hi> the twenty fift chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the fourtieth verse; so they are glad to claim brotherhood of us, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> the twenty second chapter; as the Angel said to <hi>John, I am one of thy brethren.</hi> In as much as God exalts the male child and the woman to be in his Throne, the Angels are ready to fight for them.</p>
               <p>In that it is said, <hi>The Dragon prevailed not,</hi> it may be gathered, that for all that he might begin again; but where it is added,
<hi>And their place could no more be found in Heaven,</hi> thereby we learn that <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels set upon the Dragon and his Angels, and drave them out of Heaven.</p>
               <p>That which ariseth from hence on our parts, is of two sorts:</p>
               <p>First, The thankfulnesse we are bound continually to render to God, that we are of such regard in his sight, that in Heaven they fight for us, the elect angels with the evil angels, <hi>Michael</hi> with the Dragon and his companie. It is that which Christ tells us, <hi>Luke</hi> the eleventh chapter,
<hi>When the strong men keep the Palace, all things are in peace; but then comes a stronger,</hi> &amp;c. Man is even in the estimation of the Devil a Palace, howsoever we by our sinnes make our selves a Hogstie: therefore both Christ and the Devil esteeming so highly of us, we may not esteem basely of our selves. The angels have charge, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keep us, <hi>Psalm</hi> the ninty first, but to wage battail about us: and<pb n="593" facs="tcp:62585:321"/>therefore it is plain, the soul of man is no mean thing. The Angels as we see, are ready to enter field with the Dragon and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: Neither doth Heaven only take this care of us, but the Earth also is ready to help us, and <hi>openeth her mouth and swalloweth up the flood which the Dragon casts out of his mouth, Apocalyps</hi> the twelfth chapter and the sixteenth verse. Therefore if they have such care of us, it is reason we should have care of our selves; if they take such care for man, that is but earth, then ought we for Heaven to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: If no man be crowned, no not the Angels themselves, <hi>except they strive aright,</hi> the second epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> the second chapter; no more shall we be crowned unlesse we be as carefull of our selves as the Angels. If the Angels were so busie to defend the earth, we must be more diligent to fight for Heaven. Again, here we see, that to come to Heaven is a matter of fight and wrastling, <hi>Ephesians</hi> the sixt chapter: If we look upon Christ and the Apostles, we will say it is <hi>Lucta,</hi> a wrastling; but if upon common Christians it is but <hi>Ludus,</hi> a pastime and sport. And he that stirrs up this warre and conflict is not dead, howsoever he was put to the worst, but only driven out of Heaven. That battail which was in Heaven among the Angels, is come down to men on earth, and now the Dragon fights with the womans seed; and therefore it imports the womans seed to fight with him: For the warre we have, is not only with flesh and blood, that is, with our own passions and affections, which is the philosophical warre; though we must fight with them also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>fleshly lusts fight against the spirit,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter and the eleventh verse: But our wrastling is chiefly with the spirits, <hi>with spiritual wickednesse in heavenly places, Ephesians</hi> the sixt chapter. And what, is this enemy the Dragon foolish and weak after his conquest had over finne? No, <hi>he is the old Serpent,</hi> therefore full of experience. These enemies or
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> the sixt chapter; therefore they want no power. But are they discouraged upon this overthrow? No, but he is the more fierce and his wrath kindled, <hi>knowing his time is but short, Apocalyps</hi> the twelfth chapter and the twelfth verse. Then seeing we have such an enemy, we must strive rightly if we will be crowned, <hi>si place at Corona, place at studium</hi> we must take the more heed to our selves, because, as <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>Magis est fortis nostrâ negligentiâ, quàm

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As we give God thanks, that he makes this account of us; so are we to thank him, that he hath created and commanded such excellent spirits to fight for us; and to pray that they which have thus fought for us in Heaven, may in earth fight with us to help us; that as they have cast him out of Heaven, so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>. Thirdly, we are to take heed that we provoke not the Angels with our misdeeds, <hi>Exodus</hi> the twenty third chapter and twenty first verse; nor alienate them<pb n="594" facs="tcp:62585:322"/>from us with the wicked words of our mouths, <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> the fift chapter and the fift verse. If we suffer our selves to sinne by filthy words and speeches, we make them turn their favour from us. When we come into the Church, we must come with a due regard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, <hi>propter Angelos,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter: for by rude and uncomely behaviour in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and by suffering our mouths to utter offensive speeches, we offend the Angels and deprive our selves of their favour, so as they will not care for our safeguard: But if as the Angel tells <hi>Danil, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> the tenth chapter and the twelfth verse, <hi>We set our hearts to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and to humble our selves by fasting before God,</hi> that may draw their affection towards us; for repentance is that <hi>which doth minister joy to the Angels in Heaven, Luke</hi> the fifteenth chapter.</p>
               <p>Lastly, By this means, though we obtain not such a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest over the Dragon as the Angels did; yet we shall attain to the first degree: though we cannot drive him out of earth, as they did out of Heaven, yet we shall obtain thus much, <hi>That he shall not prevail against us,</hi> no more than he did against them. We see it in <hi>Paul,</hi> though he fought never so much, yet he could not avoid it, <hi>but sinne would dwell in him, Romans</hi> the seventh chapter: but this victory he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>that it did not reign in his natural body, Romans</hi> the sixt chapter. Though, till our corruption be dissolved, we shall not drive him out, we shall so be armed,
<hi>That he shall not prevail against us.</hi> We must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor our selves, that by thankfulnesse to him for vouchsafing to us this help, and by intercession to continue the same, we may still resist the Dragon, not suffering our selves to take the soyl, howsoever we cannot utterly drive him out. And in this respect, when we shall be like the Angels, <hi>then shall we tread Satan under our feet, then shall the Dragon be bound in chains and cast into the bottomlesse pit;</hi> so shall we have a final conquest over him. Now we must labour to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>And so these words as they yeeld comfort to the commers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading them that they are of those, <hi>whom God the Father hath given to Christ;</hi> so no lesse comfort is reached to them here; for that they understand from Christs own mouth, <hi>That if they come to him, they shall not be cast out,</hi> but received of him, so <hi>as none shall be able to take them out of his hands, John</hi> the tenth chapter and the twenty eighth verse.</p>
               <p>On the other side, They that come not, may know from hence, that as they are not in the number of the Fathers Donatives, that is, such as are given to Christ, but are the portion of Satan, <hi>For they shall be cast out into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, Apocalyps</hi> the twenty first chapter and the eighth verse; <hi>And into utter darknesse, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth, Matthew</hi> the eighth chapter and the twelfth verse.</p>
               <p>Touching the dependance his words have with that part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which we usually have held, when we spake of <hi>Cains</hi> departure from Gods presence, we heard that he did set himself as neer
<hi>Eden</hi> as he could be; that he was content for a little trifling pleasure, that shortly fadeth, to forgoe Gods presence, <hi>where is pleasure for evermore;</hi> that for a little worldly gain with <hi>Balaam,</hi> he gives over all godlinesse, which is the true gain; and that not he, but the whole world through ambition, as Lords, doe seek the worlds honor with the losse of the honor and favour of God. Being thus departed from God, we heard he came to a Land called <hi>Nod,</hi> that is, a Land of unquietnesse and troubles, both in respect of the inward disquietness of his soul by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fear &amp; the outward vanities of the whole world; where he found that having forsaken God, with whom is fulnesse of joy, he could not have his desire satisfied by any pleasure that the world could afford. But we left not
<hi>Cain</hi> there, but heard, that the end of that journey was woe, as <hi>it shall be the end of all those that walk in Cains way, Jude</hi> the eleventh verse.</p>
               <p>And for that there is none but may fall into the same way, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns every man to think how, being departed from the presence of God, he may come back to Christ, and especially that he watch his opportunity, to come at such a time as Christ will not cast him out; And that is taught us here, in these words, where Christ saith, <hi>That whosoever commeth to him, as he is the bread of life, he shall not be cast forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we must watch this opportunity; for there are two
<hi>wenite's, Come to me all ye, Matthew</hi> the eleventh chapter, that have departed from me, to receive worldly pleasures and gain; The other, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome, Matthew</hi> the twenty fift chapter and the thirty fourth verse. But he that will have his part in this latter <hi>venite,</hi> must have his part also in the first: He must come again to Christ by repentance, else he cannot come to be partaker of the heavenly Kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="596" facs="tcp:62585:323"/>In these words of Christ we have three persons: First, <hi>Pater dans.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Homo veniens.</hi> Thirdly,
<hi>Christus non ejiciens.</hi> Whereof the two former parts be the Condition, the third person belongeth to the Promise. The Condition stands in <hi>The Fathers giving,</hi> and <hi>our comming;</hi> The Promise is <hi>Christs not casting out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching which parts joyntly, we are to observe these, That every one by experience sindes that the state of sinners, live they never so pleasantly, is but as <hi>Cain</hi> called his sonne, <hi>Chanoch,</hi> that is, a good beginning; For the mid'st of that state is unquietnesse, and the end everlasting death. Which being considered, it will make every man willing to come again to God if there be any hope, they shall be received: In regard of our selves, as <hi>St Paul</hi> speaketh of her that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from her husband, the first cpistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter and the eleventh verse, so it were just, that in as much as we have willingly forsaken God, and departed from him, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring transitory and earthly delights before his favour, he should say, <hi>Qui discedit, discedat,</hi> that being once gone from him, he should not receive usagain.</p>
               <p>But here we are to admire the goodnesse and mercy of God and Christ, that instead of a revenger and punisher, he is a mercifull receiver; that where in Justice Christ might be a rock of offence, to such as depart from him, he will be a rock of refuge to them; that he is so farre from casting out, if they come, that he is content <hi>to seek such as are lost, Luke</hi> the nineteenth chapter and the tenth verse, That he sends and sends again, that they should come back, <hi>Matthew</hi> the twenty second chapter, <hi>That he stands at the dore knocking, Apocalyps</hi> the third chapter, And saith,
<hi>Come to us all ye, Matthew</hi> the eleventh chapter: So there is no doubt but Christ will receive them that come to him. For, as the ancient Fathers note, If when he comes to us, we cast not him out, neither will he cast us out when we come to him: And that no unworthinesse by means of any filth, either of body or soul, doth keep him from us, we see for bodily uncleannesse, he was content to be received by <hi>Simon</hi> the leper, <hi>Mark</hi> the fourteenth chapter and the third verse: And in regard of spiritual pollution, howsoever a man know himself to be a sinner, that is, to have an unclean soul, yet not to despair, because Christ, by the confession of his enemies, is such a one as doth not only receive sinners, but <hi>eats with them, Luke</hi> the fifteenth chapter and the third verse; yea, he not only

               </p>
               <p>Again, it is reason Christ should receive us in two sorts.</p>
               <p>First, In respect of the communicants or commers; for there is no man ever in better state and more disposed to be received than at the celebration of this Sacrament. If a contrite spirit for sinne can set a man in state to be received of Christ, man is most contrite and broken in heart at this time: If Christ will then receive us, <hi>when he may dwell in our hearts by faith, Ephesians</hi> the third chapter, at this time is our faith at the highest; for when we have the body and blood of Christ in our hands, then it makes us say with <hi>Thomas, John</hi> the twentieth chapter, <hi>Domine mi, &amp; Deus mi:</hi> If prayer, made with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and confidence, may move Christ at any time to receive, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have more confidence in prayer than at that time; then <hi>is the love of God most of all shed in our hearts, by the holy Ghost, Romans</hi> the fift chapter and the fift verse, by which we are received not only to give, for no man is to appear empty, but also to forgive, as Christ willeth, <hi>That remembring our brethren hath ought against us, we leave our gift and be reconciled, Matthew</hi> the fift chapter: If at any one time more than other Christ be more ready to receive, then is he
<hi>maximè receptivus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In respect of the action it self, which is a memorial of that sacrifice, which he offered at his death to God for sins: Then he received the thief that said, <hi>Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy Kingdome, Luke</hi> the twenty third chapter: Then he prayed for his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Father forgive them.</hi> Therefore there is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, that now much more he must be carefull to us and receive us, when we celebrate the remembrance of his goodnesse and mercie. But the chief point is, that in the Sacrament Christ himself is received; and therefore it is very fit, that he which is to be received, be ready to receive them that come to him.</p>
               <p>The second Condition is touching the Fathers gift, <hi>All that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth.</hi> Which is a limitation: For, as many pressed upon Christ, but there was but one that tou hed, that was the woman healed of her issue of blood, <hi>Luke</hi> the eight chapter and the fourty fift verse; so many come to the Lords Table, but to the end they may be received they must be known by this mark, he must be <hi>datus à Patre, tractus, &amp; doctus, John</hi> the sixt chapter, the fourty fourth and fourty fift ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. There are that are <hi>dati ab hominibus,</hi> or, as the Apostle speaks, the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the second chapter and the thirteenth verse, <hi>ab human â ordinatione,</hi> that is, the most part come not, being given or drawn of the Father, but compelled by man: <hi>Their fear is taught by mens precepts, Matthew</hi> the fifteenth chapter, and <hi>Isaiah</hi> the twenty ninth chapter. Again, there are <hi>that have a shew of Godlinesse,</hi> the first epistle to <hi>Timothie</hi> the third chapter: Such come not upon any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods spirit, that they feel in themselves, but for fashions sake: They will not be seen to refuse the order of the Church, but doe as others doe; but they that are given to Christ of God, are such as come<pb n="599" facs="tcp:62585:324"/>of conscience, knowing they ought to performe this duty of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to God; such as hunger and thirst after the right cousnesse of Christ, the spiritual food of their souls, in conscience of their own unworthinesse and ill deservings; and therefore seek for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in him, with as great desire as for bodily food; they that come with such an earnest inclination, as given and drawn of the Father. This doth distinguish true Christians from Counterfeits, which say I know not whether the Father doe give me to Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not come: but to such Christ answers,

                  </gap> oceasion; and so Christ must wait upon them, they may not wait upon Christ. But as the Pharisees despised the counsel of God <hi>and would not be baptized by John, Luke</hi> the seventh chapter and the thirtieth verse; so doe these despise the counsel of Christ against themselves, whose purpose happily was even at this time to have received them: But because they despised his counsel, that happeneth to them which besell <hi>Saul,</hi> whom <hi>Samuel</hi> tels, That if he had kept the Lords commandement, <hi>he had now established his kingdome for ever upon Israel,</hi> the first book of <hi>Samuel</hi> the thirteenth chapter and the thirteenth verse: but for that he despised the oportunity now, it is removed to another.

<hi>casting into utter darknesse,</hi> which Christ speaketh of.</p>
               <p>There is a second <hi>for as,</hi> that is, out of the Church, as <hi>John</hi> the ninth chapter and the thirty fourth verse, of whom Christ saith, <hi>Mark</hi> the fourth chapter and the eleventh verse, <hi>but to them which are without,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the fift chapter and the twelfth verse, <hi>What have ye to doe with them that are without?</hi> that is, the Heathen: And this is nothing but a disposition to the second <hi>for as,</hi> that is, to be cast out of the Kingdome of Heaven; of which, <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps</hi> the twenty second chapter and the fifteenth verse, <hi>for as autem er ant canes,</hi> and <hi>to be cast into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, where their smoak shall ascend for ever, where the worm never dyeth, and the fire is never quenched, where they shall wish for death, and death shall flie from them.</hi> This is the state of them that are <hi>cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Christ promiseth, <hi>That who so commeth to him, being given, shall not be cast out, but shall be quit from death and damnation:</hi> He doth not only receive them, and eat with them; but receives them into that union that is <hi>inter alitum &amp; alimentum,</hi> that is, to be one with him; which is a greater union than is either between brother and brother, or between man and wife; for herein is that verified, <hi>That we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be partakers of the Divine nature,</hi> by partaking whereof, he is in us and we in him; we and Christ are made one; we receive him, and he receives us: So that as God cannot hate Christ, so he cannot but love us, <hi>being ingraffed into him.</hi> Thus it comes to passe that we are <hi>not cast out,</hi> but are made partakers of all the good things of Christ, who saith to him that comes to him, <hi>Luke</hi> the fifteenth chapter, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia nostra tua sunt,</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> the fifteenth chapter, <hi>Intra in gaudium Domini,</hi> that is the chief point in this promise.</p>
               <p>As for them that come not to Christ, howsoever they deserve to be cast out, yet Christ doth not cast them out, but they cast out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in as much as they sever themselves from this Sacrament, which is the holy of holiest; and from the memorial of his loving kindness: He that commeth not to the Lords Supper, sets himself in the state of the Heathen; which albeit they have a kinde of prayer, and a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, no lesse than we, yet come not so farre as to celebrate this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He is in no better state than the Jews and Turks, which albeit they beleeve the creation of the world, and the last Judgment, yet acknowledge not Christ, nor come to him <hi>tanquam panis vitae.</hi> But they must come to the Lords Supper, if they will be bidden to the Lambs Supper: Neither may they defer to come at their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; for it may be now is the time that Christ will receive them, and if they neglect the opportunity, they shall be cast out, as <hi>Saul</hi> was, in the first book of
<hi>Samuel</hi> the thirteenth chapter.</p>
               <p>It remains that we stirre up in ourselves a willingnesse to come: For to come is a voluntary action, as Christ tells us, <hi>John</hi> the fift chapter, <hi>Vos non vultis venire adme, nam qui venit, ideò venit, quia voluit venire,</hi>
                  <pb n="601" facs="tcp:62585:325"/>unlesse we be as willing to come, as Christ is to receive, all is nothing, <hi>Matthew</hi> the twenty third chapter and thirty seventh verse, <hi>Quoties volui, &amp; noluistis? How often would I have gathered thy children toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even as a Hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not?</hi> Therefore we must beware of removing this willingnesse from our selves. To this end we must continually pray that Christ will work in us this willingnesse; that the Father will draw us by his spirit; and say with <hi>Peter, Matthew</hi> the fourteenth chapter and the twenty eight verse, <hi>Domine, mitte me ad te venire;</hi> let me be
<hi>in numero pusillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, non timentium;</hi> one of those little ones that willingly will come as often as they may, and not like those that swell with pride, and say another time will serve as well as now, as <hi>Davids</hi> servants said to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,</hi> in the first book of <hi>Samuel</hi> the twenty fift chapter, We come now in a good time, for thou makest a feast, and art in case to relieve us, another time peradventure thou wilt not be so prepared: So men ought to take the opportunity, and to say in their selves, Now is the time of the celebration of Gods mercy and loving kindnesse: Now we receive Christ; and therefore there is great hope, that if we come, he will receive us: Now we celebrate the memory of his death, when he was content to receive the thief that came unto him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is most likely that he will receive us, if we come to him. But if we come not now, happily we shall not be received when we would. It is Christs will, <hi>That they which are given him of the Father, be with him where he is, and may behold his glory, John</hi> the seventeenth chapter and the twenty fourth verse. Therefore it stands us upon to come to Christ, that he may receive us to be one with him in the life of grace, and partakers with him in his Kingdom of glory.</p>

<hi>quid faciemus?</hi> what to doe, that is, a hope of remission of sinnes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Of instruction touching the means, That if we repent and be pricked in heart with the consideration of our sinnes as they were, we shall attain this mercie which they received. First, <hi>St. Luke</hi> sets down the Sermon of <hi>Peter.</hi> Secondly, The sruit and effect of it. As the Sermon it self propounds the death and Resurrection of Christ; so in the effect that followed of it, we see the means how we are made partakers of his death and Resurrection; and that is set down in these two verses; which contain a question and an answer. In the question is to be observed, First, the cause of it, that is, the compunction of their hearts: Secondly, the cause of that compunction, and that was the hearing of <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon.</p>
               <p>Touching this effect, which <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon wrought in the hearts of his hearers, it is <hi>compuncti sunt corde.</hi> Wherein note two things, First, the work it self. Secondly, the part wherein (of the work it self) it is said, <hi>they were pricked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein first we are to observe, That the first work of the spirit and operation of the word, is compunction of heart; howbeit the word being the word of glad tidings and comfort, it is strange it should have any such operation, but that Christ hath foretold the same, <hi>John</hi> the sixteenth chapter, <hi>When the comforter comes, he shall reprove the world of sinne.</hi> Now reproof is a thing that enters into the heart; as
<hi>Proverbs</hi> the twelfth chapter and the eighteenth verse, <hi>There is that speaketh words like the prickings of a sword;</hi> and as Christ gave warning before hand; so now when the holy Ghost was given, we see that
<hi>Peters</hi> hearers are reproved and pricked in their consciences, that they dealt so cruelly with Christ. As this

               <p>Touching the manner of this operation, we see it is not a tickling or itching, but a pricking, and that no light one, but such as pearced deeply into their hearts, and caused them to cry: Whereby we see it is not the speaking of fair words, saying with the false Prophets, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the twenty third chapter, <hi>The Lord hath said ye shall have peace;</hi> it is not that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

This is our duty from their example, and it is a good signe of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to shew us whether we be of the number of those that shall be saved; whether of the good fish that shall be gathered together, or the bad fish that shall be cast out,
<hi>Matthew</hi> the thirteenth chapter and the fourty eighth verse: So if we pertain to God, we shall feel this pricking at our hearts, after we have heard the word.</p>
               <p>The cause of this compunction is <hi>his auditis,</hi> that is, they had heard a speech of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> which did disquiet them, till they asked counsel of <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest.

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Without the Law sinne is dead; but when the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement came sinne revived, <hi>Romans</hi> the seventh chapter and the eighth verse; for <hi>sinne is a sting,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter, which lyeth dead so long as it is not reproved: But when it is reproved by the commandement of God, then it reviveth and stings the heart; it makes men have a conscience of sinne,
<hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> the tenth chapter, and when sinne is disquieted, the heart also wherein it resteth is disquieted; <hi>For the words of the wise are as goads and pricks, Ecclesiastes</hi> the twelfth chapter; and <hi>Matthew</hi> the fift chapter, <hi>as salt and mustard seed; Matthew</hi> the thirteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>as wine; To a putrified sore, Luke</hi> the tenth chapter.

                  </gap> to disquiet sinne, especially such words as <hi>Peter</hi> spake to his Auditors out of the Prophet
<hi>Joel;</hi> where he sheweth, that as Christ hath a day of resurrection, which is past; whereby he gave his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles those gifts of the spirit; so he hath another day, which is the featfull and great day of Judgement; when the word of the Rulers shall not be enough, for them <hi>that have killed the Lord of life,</hi> (though they promised to serve them harmlesse, <hi>Matthew</hi> the twenty eighth chapter:) For here they shall give an account of their cruelty to Christ.</p>
               <p>And thirdly whereas he moveth them to repentance, First, In this consideration of the day of Judgement: Secondly, of the sinne they committed, that they slue and crucified Christ: Thirdl, of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vousnesse of their sinne, that he was the sonne of God whom they dealt thus with; and every sinne hath a sting, but especially <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>as made Felix tremble, Acts</hi> the twenty fourth chapter. And
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:62585:327"/>when we hear of the Judgement to come, it should bring out of us these questions <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the eighth chapter and the sixt verse, <hi>Quid feci?</hi> and <hi>Isaiah</hi> the fifty seventh chapter and the fourth verse, <hi>Cui <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> stie and power: And
<hi>Matthew</hi> the twenty first chapter, <hi>Quid faciam?</hi> that is, he considers of the Judgments of God which belong to us: For these so grievous sinnes, these are means to prick our hearts at the hearing of the word. But yet we say, though the word of God hath this nature, yet except the work of the spirit doe concur with the word, <hi>the conscience is seared,</hi> the first epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> and the fourth chapter, and cannot be touched with any thing: The soul is possessed with the gangrene, that is, without life and feeling, so that it hath no sense, be it pricked never so deeply, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to <hi>Timothie</hi> the first chapter; but he that feels himself pricked in heart for his sinnes may assure himself his conscience is not feared, but both a heart of flesh easily to be touched with sorrow for sinne; and that his soul is not dead in sinne, but liveth spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
               <p>In the Question we have to observe, First, that this compunction made him speak; for, as the Wise-man saith, <hi>Qui pungit cor educit sermonem.</hi> So here when they were pricked, they said <hi>Men and Brethren;</hi> as if the holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> should say, if a man say nothing after he is pricked, it is nature compunction: For if when men are moved inwardly with a feeling of their sinnes, for all that, they say nothing, nor seek direction of them that are skilfull, they doe smother and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein the truth, <hi>Romans</hi> the first chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We must observe what they said, and that was <hi>Quid faciemus? what shall we doe?</hi> A first the People, then the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>,
<hi>Luke</hi> the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which is the second thing to be noted; that as true compunction is not dumb, so not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but would be doing somthing: they say not What shall we say? but <hi>What shall we doe? Quid faciemus?</hi> as if the same spirit which pricked their hearts had also taught them, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing must be done. The like question did <hi>St. Paul</hi> make, being prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Domine, quid vis me facere? Acts</hi> the ninth chapter and the sixt verse; So the Angel said to <hi>Cornelius, Goe to Joppa, and Simon shall tell thee what thou oughtest to doe, Acts</hi> the tenth chapter; So said the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to the Apostles. <hi>Acts</hi> the sixteenth chapter, <hi>What shall I doe that I may be saved, I and my houshold,</hi> and that I may be rid of the pricking of my conscience? For as compunction must not be silant; so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must it be idle or unfruitfull <hi>in the knowledg of the Lord,</hi> the second epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the first chapter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Observe after what manner they said, <hi>What shall we doe?</hi> and that was not as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> said,
<hi>Genesis</hi> the fourth chapter, and <hi>Matthew</hi> the twenty seventh chapter; Their <hi>what to doe, Quid faciemus?</hi> was a note of desparation: Nor as the P arisees said de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparately in their sury and rage, <hi>What shall we doe? John</hi> the eleventh<pb n="605" facs="tcp:62585:327"/>chapter. If such have their sinnes laid before them, their hearts will not be pricked, but cleave asunder, as they to whom <hi>St. Stephen</hi>

                  <hi>Acts</hi> the eighth chapter. The heart may be cast down with too much grief, so as a man shall say with <hi>Cain, My sinne is greater than can be forgiven;</hi> or else moved with malice and be pricked, so as they will prick again: as they that being pricked with the reproof of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,

               <p>Out of that which the ancient Fathers observe in Sorrow, we have five things to note: First, That something may be done as a remedy against sinne. For albeit we have sinned never

               <p>The Apostles answer to this question is, in the fifty eighth verse, <hi>Resipiscite,</hi> &amp;c. that is, there is something to be done, which is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of <hi>the great Mercy of God, and the virtue and power of the Sacrifice of Christ,</hi> notwithstanding the greatnesse of their sinnes.

<hi>Acts</hi> the second chapter and the thirteenth verse: Yet the Apostle telleth these grievous sinners, there is hope of forgivenesse, that to them which are yet scarce cold from the slaughter of the Sonne of God, there is a remedy to help them. Wherein the Apostle followeth the rule which Christ had before gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Apostles, in the twenty fourth chapter of <hi>Luke, To preach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and remission of sinnes to mankinde, beginning at Jerusalem:</hi> If the doctrine of remission of sinnes be first to be preached to them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom Christ was crucified, much more to the ends of the world: and that likes us well:</p>
               <p>But secondly, He tells us what we must doe; he saith not, you shall live to doe nothing, but <hi>repent and be baptized.</hi> It is not enough to be pricked in the heart for sinne past, but we must doe something. And he speaks first by way of precept, <hi>Repent,</hi> and that is, rest not in that passive part, but know that when you are pricked in your hearts, repentance must be shewed in your life: Wherewithall he sheweth, that compunction is not repentance; for here to these that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready pricked, he saith, <hi>Repent;</hi> and <hi>

                  </gap> promises, is expedient.</p>
               <p>In this verse we have to consider, First, The manner of uttering of these words; for they say not, Our hearts
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but ask the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>Did not our hearts?</hi> Secondly, The
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the verse, which consists of three parts, First, the part wherein this effect was wrought, <hi>Cor nostrum.</hi> Secondly, A passion or work, <hi>a burning.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The time, <hi>when he talked with us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, For the manner, <hi>Did not our hearts burne?</hi> Of which kinde of negative speaking, there are two examples in Scripture; First, it is a<pb n="609" facs="tcp:62585:329"/>more vehement affirmation, than if a man should only affirm a truth; as where Christ saith before, <hi>Ought not Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into glory?</hi> as if he should say, he ought without doubt: for when the matter is questionable, we use to speak affirmatively; but in a plain case that is evident and out of doubt, then we ask a question ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, as, Doth not the Sunne shine? as if one should say, It is cleere, We see it doth. So here they knew well before Christ spake to them, their hearts were cold, and their hope was saint and dead; but now remembring that while Christ spake to them, they selt their hearts warm within them; they ask, <hi>Did not our hearts burn?</hi> as if they should say, doubtlesse we felt a heat and burning within us.</p>
               <p>Another use of this negative question is asked out of Christs deed, <hi>Luke</hi> the seventeenth chapter, <hi>Were there not ten cleansed?</hi> he marvelled what was become of the other nine. This admiration serves to tax and to reprehend the unthankfulnesse of those nine which returned not to praise God: And seeing the Disciples ask the Question, <hi>Did not our hearts burn?</hi> as if they should say, seeing we felt our hearts burn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, why did we not know that it was Christ the Sonne of God, that spake to us? Surely it is not the work of a man to touch the heart, but God only; and seeing our hearts were touched thus, doubtlesse it was Christ that spake to us: Which shewes that at the present time that Christ spake to them, they felt him not; but when Christ was gone out of their sight, then they remembred that their hearts felt this heat within them; for by <hi>Jacob's</hi> experience we learn, that God may be in a place, and we not know of it; for so he confesseth, in the twenty eighth chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and the sixth verse, <hi>God was here, and I was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware;</hi> and in the ninth chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> and the eleventh verse, <hi>He will be by me, and I shall not see him;</hi> and in the thirteenth chapter of <hi>John, Quid ego faciam tu nescis nunc, scies autem posthac;</hi> that is, hereafter yee shall feel your hearts moved: So the attention of these two Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples was so great, and they were in such an extasie, that they observed no such thing, for the present, while he spake; they perceived it not till Christ had made an end, and was taken from them. For, as there are things that appear and are not, as visards and maskes which make a shew of that which is not; so there are things that appear not and yet are, as the spirits and souls of men, which are invisible. There was one that boasted of that he had not, that was the false Prophet that said to
<hi>Michaiah,</hi> in the first book of <hi>Kings</hi> the twenty second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>It is impossible that the spirit of the Lord shauld goe from me to thee:</hi> And in the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the seventh chapter, there is one that with more modesty and coldnesse saith, <hi>I think I have the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,</hi> and he had it indeed: The wisest that ever was of men saith, <hi>There is not in me the understanding of a man, Proverbs</hi> the thirtieth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the second verse: And <hi>Caiaphas</hi> that understood as little as any, as if he only understood all, said, <hi>Vos planè nihil intelligitis, John</hi> the eleventh chapter, and the fourty ninth verse.</p>
               <p>Touching the substance of the question, and the first part: First, The part wherein that which Christ spake did work, is the heart,
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:62585:330"/>which is the commander of man; for as the word comes our of the heart, <hi>bonus homo ex bono thesauro cordis sui, Luke</hi> the sixth chapter, so if it have its right course, it goeth to the heart; for there be three wards and locks to be opened, that the sound of Gods word may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that is, the eare, <hi>Psalm</hi> the fourtieth, <hi>Mine eare hast thou opened,</hi> which is the gate of wisedome. Secondly, the understanding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what is heard; of which it is said here, <hi>Their eyes were opened, Luke</hi> the twenty fourth chapter and the thirty first verse, that is,
<hi>oculi mentis, Ephesians</hi> the first chapter and the eighteenth verse. Thirdly, the heart, as <hi>Lydia's</hi> heart was opened by the Lord,
<hi>Acts</hi> the sixteenth chapter: Many are present, but hear not attentively what is said; others hear, but understand not; and some have both these degrees, and yet have not their hearts opened, and so it is to no purpose that is spoken: Though we hear and understand, yet if the heart be not touched with it, it is but <hi>verbum aerium,</hi> it is mans word, and not Gods; for the property of Gods word is, to pierce to the heart and marrow, <hi>And to the dividing of the soul, Hebrews</hi> the fourth chapter and the twelfth verse: Therefore by the eare man may examine his own heart; for unless he feel himself touched inwardly with the word, his hearing is in vain: And this is the service wich God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the twenty ninth chapter and the thirteenth verse, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> the fifteench chapter and the eighth verse,
<hi>populus labiis me hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat;</hi> so if either we bring our eares alone, or both eares and eyes, both hearken and conceive; yet so long as this is true of us, that our heart is departed from God: If the heart be not affected with the preaching of the word, it is in vain; For the profitable hearer is he that with an honest and good heart receiveth the word of God, <hi>Which is the immortall seed, that bringeth forth much fruit, Luke</hi> the eighth chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the work wrought in the heart, is a burning or kindling, as we shewed. There is a double compunction; First, when a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pricked in heart, falls into a rage, as they that heard <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> the seventh chapter: Secondly, when being prickt they seek for ease and comfort, as in the second chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the thirty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth verse: So there is a double fire: For as there is a fire from the Altar which touched the prophets mouth, <hi>Esay</hi> the sixt chapter, <hi>so fire from Topheth, Isaiah</hi> the thirtieth chapter, there are firie tongues, that fell upon the Apostes; <hi>But they came from heaven, Acts</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter; but there are firie tongues, <hi>that are set on fire of hell, James</hi> the third chapter; it is the fire from the Altar, and the firie tongues from heaven, that causeth the burning in the heart of such as hear aright, and not the fire of <hi>Topheth.</hi> For as the Devill with his hot Iron doth cauterise and sear the consciences of some, so the fire of Gods spirit doth warm the hearts of others, so as they heare the word of God with profit. As there are wicked, whose tongues and words are like pricks and swords,
<hi>Proverbs</hi> the twelfth chapter; so there are others, whose tongues are like hot <hi>Juniper coals, Psalm</hi> the one hundred and twentieth, which slanders others: For the Devill,<pb n="611" facs="tcp:62585:330"/>that

                  </hi> the twelfth chapter. As this compunction was of saith, and the other of fear; so here the good fire proceeds from love, and hope, the effect of the other, is desperate raging and hatred. The true fire is from the spirit, as it is in the sixt chapter of <hi>John, Verba mea spiritus sunt &amp; vita,</hi> for where there is spirit, there is a heat; and Christs words being spirituall, doe warm the hearts of the hearers, &amp; the Scriptures being inspired by the spirit of God, cannot but work this heat in mens hearts, besides, God saith of his word, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the twenty third chapter, and the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ninth verse, <hi>meum verbum ignis est,</hi> it is fire, no man can deny it, for whether we respect the Law, it is <hi>ignta lex, Deuteronomie</hi> the thirty third chapter and the second verse, the word of prophesie is firie, for the Prophet could not prophesie till the coal taken from the Altar had touched his lips, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the sixt chapter, and of the Gospel which Christ preached, he saith, <hi>

                     </gap> mittere in terram, &amp; quod volo misi ut ardeat, Luke</hi> the twelfth chapter and the fourty ninth verse, and after his ascention he gave order that the firie tongues should come upon the Apostles, that their word might be a firie word, that might kindle in the hearts of the hearers. Now the word of God is therefore called fire, because the quality of fire is most actuall; for as some note, that albeit many things be hid from the Sun, <hi>Yet there is nothing hid from the heat thereof; for it pierceth into all parts of the world, Psalm</hi> the ninteenth; so the word of God is such, and mighty in operation,
<hi>and sharper than any two edged sword, and entreth through, Hebrews</hi> the fourth chapter: For as the fire consumeth all things, and turneth it into fire; so doth the word of God turn the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of man into word, and not the word into affection: As the word it self is fire, so the motions which it stirreth up in the heart are firie and servent, as the Apostle sheweth, in the twelfth chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the eleventh verse, <hi>Ferventes spiritu:</hi> Fervencie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds of two affections: The one is hope, in the twelfth verse; that where before their hope was cold, now it rejoyceth and revives, verse the twenty first; the other is of love, which makes them compell him, <hi>Luke</hi> the twenty fourth chapter, to tarry with them, verse the twenty ninth; thus the word inflames their hearts with love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives their spirits, so as their hope is revived, and by working these two affections in them, he changeth them, that there is not only fire, but constancy in the word,
<hi>verba ignea faciunt igneos characteres;</hi> so as where ink may be blotted out, the stamp of the firie word of God continues for ever, and is durable. But the word hath a double ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration against sinne; First, like water, because with it the spot which comes from without is taken away. Secondly, as fire, because, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> rust must be burnt out, so the inward corruption of our nature must be eaten out, and consumed with the word; therefore the Prophet compares his preaching to melting and founding, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the sixt chapter, where he complains, the bellowes are burnt, the lead is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed<pb n="612" facs="tcp:62585:331"/>in the fire, the Founder melteth in vain, for the wicked are not taken away; as if he should say we have done all we can, and yet the rust of sinne doth not depart from them, for we have the wicked heart of lust and concupiscence burning in us, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the word is as water to quench it: And again we are slow and cold in affliction, and have need to be quickned; in which regard the word is fire: So men are frozen in their dregs, <hi>Zephaniah</hi> the first chapter and the twelfth verse, that cold must be dissolved by the heat of Gods word: Such a passion was in these, to whom Christ said, <hi>You slow of heart, Luke</hi> the twenty fourth chapter and the twenty fift verse. This coldness is driven away by the fire of Gods word: But although the word be never so sharp, yet it pricks not, unless the heart be fleshie; so the fault may be in the word sometime if it be not firie. The preaching of the word is like the striking of fire, for unless there be tinder to receive the sparks, it is to no purpose, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> soever ye strike fire; so the preaching of the word worketh not except the heart be prepared: Oile is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible, and we must pray <hi>that our hearts may be annointed with the oyle of Gods spirit,</hi> in the first epistle of <hi>St. John,</hi> the second chapter: When the word which is fire, and the grace of Gods spirit, as tinder, doe concurre, then the heart is warmed: As there must be prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before hand, to the end it may have this effect; so meditation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>My heart was hot within me, and while I thus mused, the fire kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, Psalm</hi> the thirty ninth and the third verse: If there be devotion before, and meditation after, upon that which we have heard, then the fire is kindled: This heat, how small soever it be, though it be but as <hi>smoaking flax, God will not quench it, Isaiah</hi> the fourty second chapter; for it will serve to kindle a fire in the heart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The time, when this was wrought in their hearts was,
<hi>cum loqueretur &amp; aperuit ipsis Scriptur as.</hi> Whereby we see Christ had this power to touch the hearts of his hearers not only in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, but now when they conferred privately together in the way. This was ordinary not only in Christs preaching, but to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; for <hi>while Peter spake unto them, the holy Ghost fell on them all, Acts</hi> the tenth chapter and the fourty fourth verse: But we must pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise private conference, and instruct one another by the way, as Christ did; for that was given by commandement
<hi>Deuteronomie</hi> the sixt chapter: And a promise is made by God, <hi>I will instruct thee in the way, Psalm</hi> the thirty second: But Christ did not only speak, but also open the Scriptures, that is, the words which he spake,
<hi>were not vain words, or the words of the east winde, Job</hi> the fifteenth chapter. The Scriptures must be opened and the key to open them, <hi>is the key of knowledge, Luke</hi> the eleventh chapter; without which key they cannot be opened. There are unlearned and unskilfull men that goe about to open the Scriptures, but they doe but pick the lock; they take not the right course; for it cannot be opened without the key of knowledge: He that will open the Scriptures must be like <hi>Apollo, who spake fervently, and taught exactly, diligently, the things which</hi>

The end of the Apostle in taking arguments from the Sacrament, is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; First to perswade Christians to cleanness of life, which he doth, in the first to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> the tenth chapter, <hi>Ye cannot be partakers of the Lords table, and the table of Devils.</hi> Secondly, bending him self here against Schismes and contentions that were amongst the Corinthians, he takes another argument from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Sacrament, to exhort them <hi>to the unity of the spirit;</hi> that for as much as <hi>they all are partakers of one Sacrament, and drank all of one spirit,</hi> therefore they should seek to be at unity and concord with themselves: The Apostle sheweth this to be a good consequence from the beginning of the chapter; and we see an example of this kinde of argument, in the ninth chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> where the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples say, <hi>Master, we saw one cast out Devils in thy name, and we forbade him, because he followeth not us:</hi> And this Apostle saith, in the first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the first chapter, that because they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, so that <hi>some were Pauls, some of Apollo,</hi> therefore they were no true Christians: Thus we see, that as from the Sacrament of cleanness, he exhorts them to cleanness of life; so from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of unity, he moves them to love and concord, and tells them they ought to avoid dissention. To perswade unto unity and love, nothing is more effectuall than the consideration of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body, which although it have many members, diverse in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, situation, and use; so as the one is more noble than the other, yet they grudge not one at another, <hi>For the foot doth not say, because I am not the hand, I am not of the body, nor the eare, because I am not the eye, I am not of the body,</hi> in the first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the twelfth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the fifteenth verse, neither doe they contemn one another, <hi>For the eye which is the most excellent member, doth not say to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor the head to the foot, I have no need of you,</hi> in the first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the twelfth chapter, and the twenty first verse; but contrariwise there is a sympathy and fellow feeling; <hi>So as if one member be grieved, all the rest are grieved; and if one be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, all the rest rejoyce with it,</hi> verse the twenty sixt; so if men could be perswaded that they are one body, there would not be such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and dissentions in the World as there are; for howsoever they be diverse in respect of nature; <hi>Some Jewes, some Grecians,</hi> as<pb n="615" facs="tcp:62585:332"/>also in respect of estate, <hi>some bond, some free,</hi> as the Apostle here speaks, yet their diversities are not greater than those which we see between the members of the body naturall: And now the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle goes about to perswade them they are one body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be at unity, which he doth thus: That body which hath one beginning, and one nourishment, is one body; But all the faithfull have one beginning in the fountain of regeneration, that is, in baptisme, and are all nourished with one nourishment; for they are all baptized into one body by one spirit, and all made to drink of one spirit; therefore they are all one body, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently should live in unity one with another. In regard of which unity, which the body hath not only with Christ her head, but with the members among themselves, the Apostle calleth the body Christ, in the first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the twelfth chapter and the twelfth verse.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the consideration of these things, our way is, First, to set down the necessity of being of this body: Secondly, the means how we come to be of this body; that is, by the spirit: Thirdly, that the spirit is the means; so as withall baptisme and drinking is required, that is, our incorporation into the body of Christ, which is his Church, is both by the spirit and by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</p>
               <p>For the obtaining of the spirit two things are to be practised, First, that we have a thirsting desire after the spirit; Secondly, that we ask it of God by prayer.</p>
               <p>First, For the necessity of our incorporation, whereas the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist saith, <hi>Psalm</hi> the eighty ninth, <hi>God hath not made all men for nought,</hi> we must first set down this, that there is a necessity that some should be faved; for it falls not into a man that is wise to doe any thing in vain, much less may we think that God, the fountain of wisedome, will suffer all men to perish; and therefore that there are some elected and chosen out to be saved. Secondly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our speciall aim should be to be of that number, but scattering, renting, and dividing, is an enemie to safty, and they that will be safe, must be recollected and gathered together under some head: It that which made <hi>Moses</hi> pray to God to set a rule over his people, and that the congregation of the Lord <hi>should not be as sheep which have no Shepheard, Numbers</hi> the twenty seventh chapter and the sixteenth verse:
<hi>When Christ saw the multitude, he had compassion on them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were dispersed &amp; scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepheard, Matthew</hi> the ninth chapter and the thirty sixt verse; and not only so, but Christ did that, <hi>that he might gather together in one, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God which were scattered, John</hi> the eleventh chapter and the fifty second verse. Thirdly, before Christ had a body and before he was manifested in the flesh, the Congregation was called a Synagogue, because it was then sufficient for them to be gathered together <hi>sub uno pastore,</hi> though they were not ruled by one spirit: But now they must be not only under one Shepheard, but must all<pb n="616" facs="tcp:62585:333"/>be one body, and that not a dead Carkasse, but a living body, such a body that liveth not by a soul, but by a spirit; for that is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that the Apostle makes between <hi>Adam</hi> and Christ, in the first to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the fifteenth chapter, <hi>The first man, Adam, was made a living soul, but the second Adam was made a quickning spirit.</hi> This quickning spirit is it, by which the mysticall body of Christ li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, which goeth through the body, and giveth life to every member. This is a mysticall incorporation, and is spiritually to be conceived, and the union between Christ and his mystically bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is so straight, that speaking of it, he saith, <hi>Acts</hi> the ninth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Why persecutest thou me?</hi> and the Apostle understanding the Church, calleth it Christ, in the first to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the twelfth chapter and the twelfth verse; then he that will be saved, must not be a part, but be gathered, and that into the body of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ is only <hi>the Saviour of his body, Salvator corporis, Ephesians</hi> the fift chapter and the twenty third verse. So that if a man be out of the body, and be not a member of Christs body, he cannot be saved; and so Christ himself tells us, <hi>John</hi> the fifteenth chapter, <hi>If the branch abide not in the vine, it cannot bear fruit;</hi> so <hi>unlesse a man abide in me, he cannot bear fruit,</hi> but he is <hi>sarmentum,</hi> a dry branch, <hi>and is cast forth into the fire:</hi> Whereby we see that all shall not be saved, but only they that are gathered into the mysticall body of Christ, and as members of his body, doe live by his spirit working in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This incorporation standeth of two points, First, of generation: Secondly, of nourishment. For there can be no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy except it be begotten; and the body being begotten, dissolves again, and turns to nothing, unlesse it be nourished. Such a thing we are to conceive of our incorporation, both parts whereof are expressed by ingraffing and watering: For in all things he that will be preserved in any estate, must first enter into it, and then he must remain in it.</p>
               <p>The Analogie of these two we shall finde to be in the mysticall body of Christ. First, he that will be of the body, must come in by regeneration, <hi>Titus</hi> the third chapter and the fift verse; <hi>He must be ingraffed into Christs body, Romans</hi> the sixt chapter and the fift verse; <hi>He must put on Christ,</hi> as the Apostle saith, <hi>Galatians</hi> the third chapter, as all they doe <hi>that are baptized into Christ Jesus:</hi> Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, begotten and ingraffed into the body, he must be nourished and fed, that so he may continue in that estate, he must
<hi>as a new borne babe, desire the sincere milk of the word, whereby he may grow up,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the second chapter and the second verse; He must be <hi>watered,</hi> the first epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> the third chapter; He must <hi>eat the flesh of Christ and drink his blood, that so he may abide in Christ, and Christ in him, John</hi> the sixt chapter and the fifty sixt verse. By these a man is made partaker of the body of Christ, by the other of the spirit: By baptisme we have our incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, by drinking the blood of Christ we receive the spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="617" facs="tcp:62585:333"/>Thirdly, Why doth not the blood of Christ immediatly incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us into the Church, without the mediation of water in baptism, and drinking of Christs blood in the Lords Supper?</p>
               <p>The ancient Fathers hold two reasons hereof.</p>
               <p>First, Taken from the love of Christ, that ever since <hi>Corpus assumit sibi, Hebrews</hi> the tenth chapter and the fift verse; since <hi>he took part with the Children of flesh and blood, Hebrews</hi> the second chapter and the fourteenth verse, as he consists of a spirit and a body; so he delighteth to work, not only by a spirit, but by a body also: and this is an honor that he imparteth to bodily things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He useth this course to shew his power; which appears hereby to be great, in that albeit these elements of water, and bread and wine
<hi>be weak and beggerly elements, Galatians</hi> the fourth chapter and the ninth verse; yet by his power he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> them and makes them effectual means, to incorporate us into his body, and to set us in that estate wherein we may be saved. So the one reason is a testimony of Christs humane love; the other a token of his divine power.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If we demand, Why he makes choice of water, bread and wine, rather than of any other elements. It is in regard of the proportion and analogie that they have with the things signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>The seed Where with we are begotten, is a waterish substance, and as the Scripture sheweth, water is the seed of the world, for <hi>the spirit of God moved upon the waters, Genesis</hi> the first chapter. Therefore is water used in the Sacrament of our regeneration; and because it is <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> it doth <hi>nutrire.</hi> The juice and nourishment that we suck out of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> digested, is that which nourisheth our life; and therefore the element of wine is used in the Sacrament of our nutrition, that is after we are born a new and washed with water in baptism, to signifie our new birth: then we must receive bread and wine in the Lords Supper, to confirm our saith in the body and blood of Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are sealed unto eternall life. There is another reason why God worketh our incorporation by the means of these elements, and that is, <hi>that as out of darknesse he commanded light to shine,</hi> the second epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> the fourth chapter, so he might work our salvation by that which was our destruction. Therefore because the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the world was by water, wherein, as <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>All the world perished, except a few even eight persons:</hi> So it is his pleasure, by the water of baptism as an outward means to save us, the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the 3. chapter: That as by water was the deluge of the world; so by it might be the deluge of sin. It was the eating of the forbidden meat that destroyed the world; therefore he hath thought it good, by eating to save men: that as then it was said, <hi>If ye eat, ye dye, Genesis</hi> the second chapter; so now it is said, <hi>except ye eat the flesh of the Sonne of man, ye have no life in you, John</hi> the sixt chapter and the fifty third verse.</p>
               <p>Now the mediation of these elements are no lesse necessary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and keep us as lively members of the mysticall body of Christ,
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:62585:334"/>than bread and wine are to maintain natural life. The People whom <hi>Saul</hi> commanded to

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> with fasting, <hi>that their soul was ready to goe out of them,</hi> the first book of <hi>Samuel</hi> the nineteenth chapter: Therefore when <hi>David</hi> and his men <hi>were hungry and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and thirsty in the wildernesse, Barzillai and others came and brough pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,</hi> the second book of <hi>Samuel</hi> the seventeenth chapter, and the twenty ninth verse:
<hi>When Abraham returned from the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of five kings, Melchisedeck met him with bread and wine, Genesis</hi> the fourteenth chapter. So it is with the faithfull, unlesse this spiritual life be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steined with these outward helps: Therefore the Apostle faith, <hi>We are all made to drink of the same spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our of which words for matter of Doctrine, where Christ saith,
<hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> the Adversary saith, that it was spoken to the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and therefore it is lawfull for none but Priests to receive the Cup in the Supper. But <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh more generally, <hi>Nos omnes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati sumus,</hi> not only the Clergy but Lay men: And that both parts of the Sacrament was administred to all sorts, appears by D. <hi>Aropa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gita,</hi> and as the Apostle faith, <hi>We are all partakers of one bread,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the tenth chapter and the seventeenth verse, he doth not excluse the other part: So here by drinking he understands both parts of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We see there is a necessity of eating, in as much as God appoints that the means where by he will communicate his spirit,
<hi>Acts</hi> the fift chapter. He gives the spirit to none but such as obey him; Therefore we must obey him when he commands us to use this means, especially seeing he commands them with a <hi>nisi, John</hi> the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Except a man be born again of water;</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> these conditions and for these uses are we commanded to drink of the same spirit. If we drink the blood of Christ, we shall drink the spirit of life, which it gives, <hi>and so shall we live by him, John</hi> the sixt chapter and the fifty seventh verse; <hi>Christ shall live in us,

Therefore, if we will drink the spirit, it is required First, That he thirst after spiritual things no lesse than after worldly things; <hi>John</hi> the seventh chapter, <hi>Si quis sitit ad me veniat &amp; bibat,</hi> vers the thirty seventh. Secondly, He must pray for the spirit; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>God giveth his spirit to them that ask it, Lake</hi> the eleventh chapter: So <hi>while Jesus was baptized and prayed, the Heavens opened and the holy Ghost came down upon him, Luke</hi> the third chapter and the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> after the spirit, and pray for it, else we cannot<pb n="619" facs="tcp:62585:334"/>have it. But if we come <hi>non sitientes omnino</hi> without any sense of our own want, or come only with
<hi>a form of Godlinesse,</hi> the second epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> the third chapter and the fift verse; we may drink the outward object, but not the spirit; for they that come thus pray not to God to be made partakers of the spirit, as of the object. And to this we may add, as a reason of our unprofitable drinking, <hi>how can we
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the spirit, seeing we sow only to the flesh, Galatians</hi> the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> chapter. In as much as we sow no spiritual works, we cannot be partakers of the spirit. These are the means to obtain the spirit. Then when we have drunk, we must examine our selves, whether we have drunk the spirit; which we shall know thus: A drink and potion is either for recovery of health, or for comfort or refreshing. If we finde
<hi>that the blood of Christ hath purged our consciences from dead works, Hebrews</hi> the ninth chapter; and <hi>that we mortifie the deeds of the flesh by the spirit, Romans</hi> the eighth chapter, then have we drunk of the same spirit. If we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the power of sinne abated in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, and the will of sinne by this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, then have we drunk the spirit. Secondly, For refreshing, which is the other use of drinking, as <hi>Psalm</hi> the seventy eighth and the sixty fift verse, <hi>The Lord arose out of sleep, as a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> refreshed with wine:</hi> there comes courage to a man by drinking of the spirit; so as he hath a desire to spiritual drink: <hi>Ephesians</hi> the fift chapter, <hi>Be not drunk with wine, but be filled with the spirit.</hi> Now they call the holy Ghost <hi>new wine, Acts</hi> the second chapter, <hi>these men are filled with new wine:</hi> For indeed as the one, so the other gives greater alacrity and cheerfulnesse.</p>
               <p>In respect of these two effects, it is termed the holy spirit of God and therefore, First, He that having drunk findes in his soul a comfortable anointment, the first epistle of <hi>John</hi> the second chapter, <hi>the seal of the spirit, Ephesians</hi> the first chapter and the thirteenth verse, and
<hi>the earnest,</hi> the second epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the first chapter and the twentieth verse, he hath a signe that he hath drunk the spirit. But these <hi>sensualiter,</hi> are not enough; they may deceive us; there were that eat and drank in Christs presence, but he told them, <hi>I know you not, Luke</hi> the thirteenth chapter. Therefore to the comfort of the spirit we must add the holy spirit, and see what operation he hath; we must see if we can finde <hi>sanctificationis spiritum,</hi> the second epistle to the
<hi>Thessalonians</hi> the second chapter <hi>and the fruits of the spirit</hi> wrought in us after we have drunk, <hi>Galatians</hi> the fift chapter and the twenty second verse, whether we be transformed by the same spirit, the second to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the third chapter. Thus we see the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in this place, <hi>against the spirit that lusteth after envy and contention, James</hi> the fourth chapter, useth the Sacrament of unity, to perswade men to unity and love; and against the unclean spirit, he useth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of cleannesse, as, in the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the sixt chapter, <hi>Shall I take the members of Christ and make them the members of an Harlot?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the effects that the spirit worketh in us, we may know whether we have the spirit; for we are not only made partakers of Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:62585:335"/>in Baptism, but of the spirit in the Lords Supper; <hi>If we cleave to the Lord Christ, we are made one spirit,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>

               <p>Concerning which, A promise being once past, is no more a free thing, but becomes a debt, and in justice is to be performed; in which respect the Apostle saith, in the second epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> the fourth chapter, <hi>There is laid up for me a crown of righteousnesse, which the Lord, the just judge, shall render to me;</hi> and hence the Prophet is bold to challenge God with his promise, <hi>Psalme</hi> the hundred and nineteenth,
<hi>Perform thy promise, wherein thou hast caused me to put my trust,</hi> and therefore <hi>Augustine</hi> saith; <hi>Redde quod non accepisti, sed quod premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Promises doe affect two wayes, because they stand upon two points; First, The party promising: Secondly, The thing promised.</p>
               <p>If it were the promise of a man, it were to be doubred of, for
<hi>all men are lyars, Psalm</hi> the hundred and sixteenth; They either promise that which they cannot perform, as <hi>being weak,</hi> as
<hi>Psalm</hi> the twenty first and the tenth verse; or which they will not perform, as <hi>Naball</hi> in the first book of <hi>Samuel</hi> and the twenty fist chapter. But if we can finde one that is both able and willing to keep his promise, that is a great kindnesse, not to be distrusted. And such a one is God; who, of his own goodnesse, is become indebted to us, by <hi>making us most great and pretious promises:</hi> he is true of his word; for he is <hi>Deus men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiri nesciens, Titus</hi> the first chapter, <hi>he cannot lye:</hi> And for his power and ability, <hi>Apud eum non erit impossibile omne verbum, Luke</hi> the first chapter: And for his willingnesse the Angels testifie of it, that there<pb n="621" facs="tcp:62585:335"/>is in God <hi>good milk towards men;</hi> even the same which he heares to Christ his own Sonne, of whom he

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, For the thing promised: Though it be God that

                  </gap> yet if the thing promised be a matter of no great value, wee respect it the lesse, but this is <hi>a great and most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Secondly, It is pretious in regard that it cost dearly; <hi>For wee are bought, not with corruptible things, as silver and gold,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Thirdly, It is a pretious promise in this respect, because our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse here promised, stands, not only in having our sinnes forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or in being made righteous; that is not the thing we are

                  <hi>many;</hi> and in the seventeenth chapter of
<hi>John,</hi> and the third verse, <hi>This is eternall life, to know thee and Jesus Christ.</hi> The Heathen and Turkes are not capable of this pretious promise, because they take no notice of Christ: It is a promise made to Christians, for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are partakers of flesh and blood, <hi>He also took part with them, Hebrews</hi> the second chapter: As Christ took part of our nature, so he makes us partakers of his. It is the Christian only that beleeves this; and therefore he is capable of this so pretious promise; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Christ were man, yet <hi>it pleased God, that the fulnesse of the God head should dwell in him bodily, Colossians</hi> the second chapter and the ninth verse; and as he is in us by his humanity, so are we in him in respect of his Divinity. God partakes with Christ because of his Divine nature, and man partakes with Christ in as much as he hath assumed our humane nature: He is partaker of our humane nature, for <hi>he is flesh of our flesh, and bone of our bone, Ephesians</hi> the fifth chapter; and we, by his Spirit, <hi>are partakers of his Divine nature;</hi> for in the first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the

               <p>Christ imputeth his nature two wayes; First, by regeneration in Baptisin; <hi>for except ye be born again of water and the holy Ghost, John</hi> the third chapter: Secondly, by eating and drinking in the Sacrament: In which respect the Apostle saith, that we must <hi>bibere spiritum,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the twelfth chapter and the thirteenth verse. In this life we must seek for Gods grace and glory; and he hath promised to give both, <hi>Psalm</hi> the eighty fourth; and then we shall
<hi>Intrare in gaudium Domini, Matthew</hi> the twenty fift chapter; and so
<hi>we shall be alwaies with him,</hi> the first epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the

                  <pb n="625" facs="tcp:62585:337"/>Care, or Diligence, the Apostle maketh the first part of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from ill, the second epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> the seventh chapter: And it is the same word in both places; It is here the God of repentance; and the Apostle he makes it the gates of affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative virtues, and a good life; the one for taking away sinne, the other for bringing in of godlinesse. There are many kinds of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; but this is that a man useth, when he makes it <hi>tempestiva diligentia;</hi> when a man having day before him, he doth not put off till the end,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Psalm</hi> the hundred and nineteenth, <hi>I made haste and prolonged not to keep thy commandements;</hi> and in the third chapter, <hi>looking for and hasting to the comming of the day of the Lord.</hi> As we must look for it, so make haste to meet him joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>Now we know the nature of it, we will consider the degree of it in the word <hi>all,</hi> not some kinde of care or indeavor, but <hi>all diligence. Seeing we have great and pretious promises,</hi> in the higiest degree, let our diligence be in the highest degree. Men must not perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves it is an easie matter to be a good Christian; but a thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all care and diligence is to be shewed, and he had the spirit of God to direct him, <hi>He layeth upon us no other burdens, then necessary commandements, Acts</hi> the fifteenth chapter and the eighteenth verse. Our Saviour Christ, by crying often <hi>Watch and pray, Mark</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter, <hi>Take heed, Luke</hi> the thirteenth chapter, <hi>Strive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the streight gate, Matthew</hi> the seventh chapter, <hi>Labour not for the meat that perisheth, John</hi> the sixt chapter, calling entrance into life, <hi>as hard as for a camel to passe through the eye of a needle, Luke</hi> the sixteenth chapter, shews, men may not think but it requires <hi>all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence</hi> and contention. If the preservation of mans body cannot be without caring for apparel and meat; And if humane nature be decayed, and will not be repaired without cost, there must be care and diligence to keep a good dyet; then our union and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Deitie is no matter of ease. We must use diligence both in ceasing from evil and following good, and that in as good degree as we can; for when we have done what we can, yet it is true, in the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the fourth chapter, <hi>justus vix servabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Unto which we add thirdly, that the word <hi>give,</hi> here used, is very effectual: It is used two wayes, It is to bring in a thing with an opposition; as if the Apostle said, Heretofore ye have shewed great diligence in vanities; ye can watch, spend your time and money: Shew the like diligence in following good. The other is a sense used in the sixt chapter to the <hi>Galatians</hi> and in <hi>Judes</hi> epistle, that if Hereticks cannot get in, they will creep in craftily: in the next chapter he saith, <hi>Privily bringing in heresies;</hi> and the same <hi>Jude</hi> verse the fourth: So here it is brought in by imitation. We must be as carefull to possesse our selves with good, as the wicked are to joyn vice to vice. It is Christs advise,
<hi>Luke</hi> the sixteenth chapter, <hi>The children of light to be as wise as they of the world.</hi> This joyning is
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, It hath a plain expression in the 68. <hi>Psalm,</hi>
                  <pb n="626" facs="tcp:62585:338"/>
                  <hi>The singers went before, the players went after:</hi> This procession in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a Quier, is the true motion signified by this word. It is used by the Apostle, speaking of the body in the fourth chapter to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> and the second to the
<hi>Colossians</hi> and the nineteenth verse: This coupling of one bone with another, thus orderly marching or training, he calls by the same name: Such a thing the Apostle exhorts unto here. From hence we learn, that Christianity or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is as a Quier, consisting of many veins; or a body, of many parts. It is not a thing stancing of one virtue; they that have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christ truly,
<hi>Ephesians</hi> the fourth chapter, have learned first <hi>to put off the old man, and then to put on the new.</hi> And so the Apostle reckoning up, as a great train of virtues, as <hi>Peter</hi> doth here; and <hi>St. Peter</hi> saith, verse the ninth, <hi>They that conceive not so of Christianity, are blinde, and cannot see afarre off:</hi> When in the Scripture, we finde any main matter of weight said upon one virtue, we must take a part for the whole, it is but one virtue of the train. As there are many parts of repentance, the second epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the seventh chapter; so the Apostle gives a compleat harnesse, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of seven several parts, <hi>Ephesians</hi> the sixt chapter.</p>
               <p>As they that are partakers of the Divine nature, are a body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact of many joynts and sinnews; so the divine spirit is not one alone, but as the ancient Fathers define the eleventh verse of the seventh chapter of
<hi>Isaiah,</hi> and the fourth chapter of the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This is not <hi>promiscuè,</hi> confusedly; but orderly as in a Quier, one begins, another follows: This multitude of virtues is <hi>Acies ordinata, Canticles</hi> the sixt chapter, like the marching of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; for it comes from God, <hi>who is the God of order and not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, All at once doe not break out, but there is a successive bringing in one of the other. In that order there are degrees, First, <hi>Faith:</hi> Secondly, <hi>Virtue:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Knowledge.</hi> The number of virtues be eight, as eight parts of repentance, in the second epistle to the <hi>Corinth ans</hi> the seventh chapter. Those contain our separation from the Devils nature: As the other are our union with Gods nature, which are usually compared to those eight steps, in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the fourtieth chapter, from the thirty first to the fourty first verse, they are our assents, whereby we approach to the Altar; so the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of blessednesse which our Saviour speaketh of, are eight, <hi>Matthew</hi> the fift chapter.</p>
               <p>Another thing to be observed is, That of these eight there are four pair; for to a theologicall virtue is added ever more a moral: <hi>Faith, knowledge, godlinesse,</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> are theologicall; to evey one of these there is a moral virtue.</p>
               <p>To come to the particulars, we shall observe that faith begins and charity ends, as <hi>Galatians</hi> the fift chapter, <hi>fides per charitatem ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur:</hi> So in <hi>Peter</hi> faith works till it come to love; <hi>He that will come to God must beleeve, Hebrews</hi> the eleventh chapter; but <hi>that is nothing without love,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="627" facs="tcp:62585:338"/>Love is the bond of perfection,
<hi>Colossians</hi> the third chapter, <hi>Above all have love, which is the chain of perfection.</hi> Faith is a most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus thing; so he saith verse 1. And it hath this honor, to be the root and foundation of all, as
<hi>Colossians</hi> 2. <hi>grounded in faith;</hi> it is the ground of all vertue, it is <hi>Choragus,</hi> the first that leadeth the dance. Men hope to receive the end of faith, and <hi>that is the salvation of souls,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the first chapter; then faith is the beginning of it. To this truth we must add another truth; that as it is the first, so but a part; and not as the world would have it, to be all. Because <hi>faith commeth by hearing, Romans</hi> the tenth chapter, the world is all set on hearing; but in the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the twelfth chap. the body is not all an eare: Faith is but a part, and that an eighth part. As here we have warrant from <hi>St. Peter,</hi> it is the first,
<hi>ergo</hi> we must begin at it, but not to stand there, but goe further. As it is <hi>choragi,</hi> so <hi>epicorigia,</hi> that is, not so compleat of it self, but something is to be joyned to it. For faith, <hi>St. Peter,</hi> the fittest to take instruction from, who shewed the failing and waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his faith, when Christ asked him, <hi>Lovest thou me?</hi> he answered <hi>Thou knowest that I love thee, John</hi> the twenty first chapter. But how knew he it, when he denyed him before a poor Damosel; <hi>Matthew</hi> the twenty sixt chapter. And in respect of Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> the twenty second chapter and the thirty second verse, <hi>I have prayed for thy faith:</hi> Christs promise and his own experince may perswade us, he knew the nature of faith: And this is an infallible mark of time faith, that it hath joyned virtue, and is taught of the Law of God; and true faith doth not abrogate the Law; nay, <hi>Romans</hi> the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>the Law is established by faith.</hi> Faith must bring in virtue by the hand: So in that great chapter of faith, having gone through all, he faith, <hi>They chused rather to suffer, than to enjoy pleasures of sinne, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> the eleventh chapter. <hi>Paul</hi> saith true faith
<hi>operatur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; per charitatem:</hi> So <hi>Peter</hi> here, and <hi>James</hi> the second chapter and the twenty second verse, it doth <hi>cooperari;</hi> that is the figne
<hi>James</hi> gives of faith: In the first epistle of <hi>John</hi> the fift chapter, the figne of true faith is, it overcomes not only the Devil, but the world, and the pleasures, riches, honors of the world, as in <hi>Hebrews</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter: It is the same signe that, <hi>Hebrews</hi> eleventh chapter and the fourth verse, shewed it self in <hi>Moses,</hi> when he refused to be the sonne of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter: And <hi>Jude,</hi> in the twentieth verse, saith, If it be true faith, it is <hi>fides sanctificans.</hi> So they all agree, <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Faith must work rightcousnesse; Peter, It must bring virtue in by the hand; John, It must overcome the world;</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> saith, <hi>It is a sanctifying faith,</hi> not locked up in a mans conscience. So that it is no true faith, which virtue follows not.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Apostles minde is to shew, That the life of a Christian is no single thing, but a Quire or Dance, and the beginning of the train is
<hi>faith:</hi> For, if we must be elevated <hi>to be partakers of the Divine nature,</hi> as verse the first, it must be a divine thing that must effect this; and the first divine thing is <hi>divina veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi> the same which the Prophets in all ages have described to us. Which divine truth we apprehend by faith.</p>
               <p>Now because there may be deceipt in our faith, we must take heed that it be not a rotten faith. There is <hi>fides ficta,</hi> the first epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> the first chapter and the fift verse, <hi>Faith feigned;</hi> and <hi>a dead faith, James</hi> the second chapter. There is a vile faith as well as a like pretious faith: And that we may separate the pretious from the vile, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the fifteenth chapter. And if we will know which is the pretious faith, for which Christ prayed, in <hi>Luke</hi> the twenty second chapter, it is not that which is alone, but which is accompanied with other virtues. It must not be <hi>totum integrale,</hi> or <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> but like a Quire, wherein are diverse parts, faith is but a part, and the eighth part of Christianity. This company is not added <hi>ad ornatum,</hi> but for necessity; therefore he exhorts, <hi>Give all diligence, and he that hath not these is blinde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To proceed, If faith be not all, what is that company he speaketh of?</p>
               <p>The first is Virtue, A word which the Scripture hath taken from Philosophers, whereof all their books are full; and albeit we must beware
<hi>that no man spoile us through Philosophie, Colossians</hi> the second chapter, yet we may not contemne it. <hi>We are called to glory and virtue,</hi> verse the third; and <hi>Philippians</hi> the fourth chapter and the eighth verse, <hi>If any virtue.</hi> It is not to be taken generally; for so it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all: It comprehends not moral virtues more than theological, but a more special thing. By Virtue is not meant an honest life, nor faith; but virtue is used either for an active power, as in the first epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the first chapter and the twenty fourth verse; or some notable effect, as <hi>Galatians</hi> the third chapter and the fift verse: It is used either in opposition to weaknesse, as in the first epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the fifteenth chapter and the fourty third verse, and the second epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the twelfth chapter and the ninth verse, <hi>Virtus mea perficitur in infirmitate;</hi> or in opposition to fear, as in the second epistle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> the first chapter and the seventh verse, <hi>Not the spirit of fear, but of power.</hi> By Virtue is meant that <hi>acrimena sinapis,</hi> as Christ speaketh, <hi>If you had faith but as a grain of mustard-seed:</hi> this is that must be added to faith; then shall that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <p>It is called Grace in respect of God, from whom it comes; and virtue in regard of the effects, The Philosopher called them <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> because they had them from themselves; but <hi>virtus est

It is by good consequence, that it is so called, <hi>because it is wrought by the Gospel, which is the power of God, Romans</hi> the first chapter and the sixteenth verse: <hi>His words are spirit and life, John</hi> the sixt chapter: Virtue must bring forth virtus. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers Virtue had no divine thing in it; they enured themselves to it, and so ascribed it to themselves. Our virtue proceedeth from faith, which is a divine thing,
<hi>Whatsoever is not of faith is sinne, Romans</hi> the fourteenth chapter: But the Heathen called their virtues <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,</hi> as from themselves, not from the grace of God.</p>

               <p>By this successive coupling we are taught, not to stay at virtue, but to proceed <hi>de virtute in virtute, Psalm</hi> the eighty fourth and the seventh verse, <hi>from strength to strength.</hi> As before against infirmity and weaknesse of our nature, he added virtue; So for our error and ignorance, he joyneth knowledge: for there may be an active power to work, and yet <hi>not aright,</hi> as <hi>Romans</hi> the tenth chapter &amp; the second verse, <hi>They have zeal, but not according to knowledge:</hi> But there must be, not only power, but wisdome; not only <hi>homines improbi,</hi> shall be cast out, but <hi>foolish vigins Matthew</hi> the twenty fift chapter. As virtue is required, so is knowledge, to direct us in that we doe. We must seek for <hi>Non tam virtutem quam aurigam virtutis scientiam, sine quâ ipsa virtus est vitium;</hi> therefore <hi>Proverbs</hi> the twenty third chapter and the fourth verse, <hi>Cease from thy wisdome;</hi> And in
<hi>Ecclefiastes</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter, Be not <hi>nimium just us: Knowledge is a key, Luke</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter and the fifty second verse: And a Quire must have a key to set the song, that is, <hi>the key of knowledge.</hi> In the Law nothing was to be offered without salt, that is, the grace of knowledge. It is that which the Apostle calleth, <hi>the inward annointing,</hi> in the first epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>John</hi> the second chapter and the twentieth verse, which gives a sweet savour and sent to God: So saith the Apostle, in the second epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the second chapter,
<hi>We are a sweet savour to God.</hi> But is not faith knowledge? It is: But yet where the object of faith is <hi>verum &amp; falsum.</hi> Science hath for its object good and evil; as <hi>Genesis</hi> the second chapter and the ninth verse, the passions of Christ, and the torments of Hell, are indifferently the objects of faith, but the affections are stirred by good and ill: And it is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that must discern between good and ill; evil things may goe under the shew of good; and therefore we must have knowledge to unmask them. So the doctrin of repentance, being a good thing, hath a shew of ill; and, without the grace of knowledge, men are hardly brought to beleeve it. As there is

<hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> the sixt chapter and the twentieth verse.

<hi>Thessalonians,</hi> the first chapter and the eleventh verse, and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>To virtue knowledge;</hi> now in the fourth place he joyneth to it temperance: It is the common course of the world, so soon as they have a little taste of knowledge to ascend up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but he tells us, knowledge must goe down to our fouls, and then proceed to godliness, which we are taught in our conformity to our Saviours example, of whom the Apostle saith,
<hi>Ephesians</hi> the fourth chapter and the ninth verse, <hi>He that ascended, the same is he that descended first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chief point of our duty is, first to temper our affections, and then to come to godliness after: For the justifying of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> order in respect of the consequence this hath with the former, there are three causes why he bringeth in temperance next after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>The first is, because whereas <hi>corruption is in the world through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> verse the first; and <hi>Ephesians</hi> the fourth chapter, <hi>The old man is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt through lust;</hi> and the abandoning of that corruption, must bring us to <hi>the participation of the divine nature;</hi> and it is comparance that makes us avoid this corruption: For unlesse we temper our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we shall never be partakers of the divine nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It follows the natural power of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Having placed Knowledge, which is a virtue of the reasonable part, he comes next to the affectioned part, that is, Desire, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> temperance answers, he would not have sensuality grow
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, nor the body to govern the soul: The upper part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:62585:341"/>perfected, the lower part must next in order be made perfect, as in the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the fifteenth chapter, <hi>That which is natural is first, and then that which is spiritual.</hi> So moral virtues are the perfections of men in this life, and theological virtues are the perfections in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Knowledge being the virtue that teacheth what is good or evil, Temperance follows it very well, in as much as it is a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per forward, and a preserver of good, <hi>It keeps us from the graves of lust, Numbers</hi> the eleventh chapter: It preserves reason which is the power of the minde: For by worldly cares we doe <hi>gravare cor, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the heart, Luke</hi> the twenty first chapter and the thirty fourth verse; but this temperance makes it, and therefore is called
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of keeping the minde and understanding safe. And for the body we see the effect of this virtue, in
<hi>Daniel</hi> the first chapter and the fifteenth verse: therefore the Apostles counsel to young men is, in the second epistle of <hi>Timothy</hi> the second chapter and the twenty second verse, <hi>Flye the lusts of youth;</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> the second chapter and the third verse, <hi>To be temperate and sober minded.</hi> It preserves knowledge, not only by keeping the body in order, but, <hi>Proverbs</hi> the twenty third chapter, the fourth verse, and
<hi>Romans</hi> the twelfth chapter and the third verse,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not to deal in genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies and curious questions, which are unprofitable, but <hi>to be wise with sobriety, Titus</hi> the third chapter and the ninth verse, and the first epistle to
<hi>Timothy,</hi> the first chapter and the fourth verse. So it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows by good order, in as much as it preserves the virtue going before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Touching temperance what it is, and wherein it stands. When knowledge hath taught what to chuse, the next thing is, <hi>nullis inde illecebris avocari;</hi> and that is it which Temperance performs: For in the beginning this corrupter of the world sought to draw our Parents away from their duty, by a baite he shewed them, <hi>bonum delectabile,</hi> that was the goodly fruit, so fair to behold: the allurement being offered, concupiscence flyeth to it, <hi>as a bird to the snare, Proverbs</hi> the seventh chapter and the twenty third verse. Every man is

                  </gap>, <hi>James</hi> the first chapter and the fourteenth verse, <hi>There is a bait offered to lust to catch at;</hi> therefore it is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>Hebrews</hi> the twelfth chapter, sinne is so pleasant, that if concupiscence be not weaned, there is no child desires the mothers breast more than it desires sinne, <hi>Psalm</hi> the hundred thirty first and the second verse, men being in this case, <hi>and add drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to thirst, Deuteronomie</hi> the twenty ninth chapter and the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse, and seek baits to allure concupiscence: therefore our concupiscence needs a bridle to wean and restrain this soul. Lust is two fold, the first <hi>Epistle</hi> of
<hi>John</hi> the second chapter and the sixteenth verse, <hi>carnis &amp; occulorum:</hi> The corruption of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is either for the belly, as it is in the sixth chapter of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> or that carnall pleasure that
<hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Drusilla</hi> were over come with, <hi>Acts</hi> the twenty fourth chapter, so that he could not abide to heare <hi>Paul</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute<pb n="633" facs="tcp:62585:341"/>of temperance; <hi>the eye lusteth for faire apparell,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter, <hi>to bee cloathed in purple,</hi> for that is a hait of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as <hi>Achan,</hi> when hee saw the Babylonish garment, desired it, <hi>Joshuah</hi> the seventh chapter;
<hi>So also the eye delighteth in bedding and furniture for houses,</hi> as
<hi>Jer</hi> the twenty second chapter and the fourteenth verse, <hi>to have it shine with Cedar, to lye on beds of Ivory, Amos</hi> the sixt chapter and the fourth verse; Temperance is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frainer of all these. For the desire of the belly, the first of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> and the ninth chapter, <hi>They that run a race absteyne from all meat that may hurt:</hi> For carnall pleasure, <hi>If they cannot contein let them marry,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the seventh chapter: And for apparell, that must bee done in temperance, the first epistle to <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and the second verse; thus wee see what is the object of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which virtue performes two things; First, to bee able to want those things, as <hi>Philipians</hi> the fourth chapter, <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum deficere;</hi> then, having them, to use them moderatly; as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle counsels in <hi>Timothie,</hi> 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 5. <hi>modico vino utere;</hi> for many, comming to have the possession of these things, exceede in Ryot. For the first, it is a dangerous lust, how pleasant soever it bee; not to bee able to want them, if wee make necessary lusts of them, so as wee must have our lusts satisfied though it cannot bee without sinne, wee bring our selves under the power, as it is in the second epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> and the eight chapter, if wee make our selves debtors to the flesh so farre, <hi>Romans</hi> the eighth chapter, <hi>A man that cannot refraine his appetite, hee is like a City broken downe and without walls, Pro.</hi> 25. 28.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for the end, why the Apostle exhorts to this virtue, It is first to eschue corruption, and so to bring us to the divine nature; and Temperance is the virtue by which wee eschue corruption both of soule and body; for, as those things that are sweete doe stop and putrisy the body, so doe those corrupt desires of the minde, and the corruption of mankinde desires to corrupt man with these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements. If wee love, wee are not the servants of sinne, we are <hi>servi corruptionis,</hi> as it is in the second epistle of
<hi>Peter</hi> and the second chapter. For the body, it corrupts it also;
<hi>for so hee sinneth against his owne body,</hi> the first epistle to the
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and the sixt chapter; and <hi>such doe corrupt the Temple of God,</hi> the first epistle to the
<hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> and the third chapter; <hi>The flesh spotteth the garment,</hi> as it is in the epistle of Saint <hi>Jude the bed desiled, Hebrewes</hi> the thirteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; so <hi>that wee cannot possesse our vessels in holinesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly that it bee not so, Temperance must effect this; so it disposeth us to the participation of the divine nature; who is a spirit
<hi>John</hi> the fourth chapter, as they that are spirituall minded are; for
<hi>they that take care to fulfill the lusts of the flesh, Romans</hi> the thirteenth chapter, <hi>doe make their bellies their God,</hi> the thirteenth chapter of the epistle to the <hi>Philippians, and minde earthly things, such are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and are not spirituall:</hi> Temperance will make, men depart from the flesh and grow spirituall, and so be like the

                  </gap> nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="634" facs="tcp:62585:342"/>To Temperance hee exhorts to add Patience, the first voice of this quire, which the Apostle reckons among <hi>the fruits of the Spirit, Galathians</hi> the fift chapter and the twenty third verse, for three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as the Philosophers observe, to
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> there is next adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to the effective part is joyned courage: For as is observed from <hi>John</hi> the first chapter and the thirteenth verse, <hi>not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man.</hi> There are in man two wills, the will of the flesh, and the manly will; for God having planted in the Soule, desire to follow good, there followes courage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move whatsoever shall hinder our desire, and as wee have a virtue to moderate our concupiscence, or sensuality, so here is Patience, against our courage. Secondly, what makes a man intemperate but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as <hi>Genesis</hi> the twenty fift chapter, <hi>Esau must needes die, except hee have the meat hee desires;</hi> therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a virtue necessarily required in the faithfull, the sixteenth chapter of the
<hi>Proverbs,</hi> and the ninteenth chapter of the <hi>Revelations; Haec est sides &amp; patientia Sanctorum.</hi> The third reason of the dependance is,
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> vincit qui patitur.</hi> Intemperance and Impatience are the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors of the world; the one being the Nurse of Phisitians, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lawyers: And as we have had a virtue to conquer intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; so it followes by good order next, that wee have the virtue against impatience. As the one sort are said to bee clothed in white, that is, <hi>the innocency of the Godly, Apocalyps</hi> the seventh chapter and the ninteenth verse; so others (by Patience <hi>have made their garments purple, in the blood of the Lamb, Apocalyps</hi> the ninteenth chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when wee know what to doe, wee must not be drawn from it by any terror; For as the devill, to alure us to sinne, joyns <hi>dulce &amp; malum;</hi> so to keepe us from good hee joynes bitter with that which is good: He joynes to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> labour and disgrace, that by them hee may keepe us from it. Labour is a thing our nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with, <hi>durum pati;</hi> the object of this virtue is tribulation, as <hi>Romans</hi> the twelfth chapter, <hi>bee patient in tribulation,</hi> a virtue that becommeth Saints, <hi>Apocalys</hi> the ninteenth chapter, <hi>haec est fides &amp; patientia Sanctorum.</hi> For the originall of tribulation, men doe not feare the evils of the life to come; and therefore God is faine to send them crosses <hi>while they live, which must bee borne patiently,</hi> as <hi>Micah</hi> the seventh chapter, <hi>portabo iram Domini, quia peccavi.</hi> Secondly, they are sent for tryall of our faith,
<hi>ut tollet ferro rubiginem, &amp; addat
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> puritatem.</hi> That was the cause of <hi>Jobs</hi> trouble, to try his faith. The use of this virtue, in respect of men is, as <hi>Matthew</hi> the fift chapter, <hi>If they smite thee on the one cheeke, to turne the other; If they take way thy coate, let them have thy cloak also;</hi> If men reproach ye, as <hi>David</hi> was, to beare it as hee did, the second of <hi>Samuel</hi> and the sixteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>to endure the spoyling of our goods,</hi> as <hi>Hebrewes</hi> the twelfth chapter. In such cases it is the perfection of the Saints while they live here,
<hi>to possesse their Souls with Patienee,</hi> as it is in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> the one and twentith chapter.</p>
               <p>For the use the Apostle makes of this virtue, patience is needfull,<pb n="635" facs="tcp:62585:342"/>for the avoiding of corruption, <hi>Give not place to the Devil, by suffering the Sunne to goe down upon thy wrath, Ephesians</hi> the fourth chapter; <hi>For men in their impatience utter the corruption of their hearts, Michah</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter. Secondly, It makes them like God, as <hi>John</hi> the third chapter and the first verse; for there is nothing in God more divine than patience; this virtue he shewed to the old world, <hi>which he endured so long,</hi> the first epistle of
<hi>Peter</hi> the third chapter; and to the new world, the second epistle of
<hi>Peter</hi> and the third chapter, He is not slack, but patient to all, and would have all repent. The same is the affection of the Sonne of God towards his Church. What did <hi>Moses</hi> admire, <hi>Exodus</hi> the third chapter, to see the bush a fire, and not burn, but <hi>videt rubum ardentem:</hi> Even so now the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>shall drink deadly poyson, and it shall not hurt them,</hi> as Christ promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, <hi>Mark</hi> the sixteenth chapter, that is, the evil tongues of the wicked, <hi>which are as the poyson of Asps,</hi> as
<hi>Psalm</hi> the hundred and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth. The Apostles exhortation is,
<hi>James</hi> the first chapter and the fourth verse, <hi>Be patient, that ye may be intire and perfect;</hi> and as the first epistle of <hi>Peter,</hi> the fift chapter, <hi>If ye suffer but a little, God shall make you perfect:</hi> And Christs advise is, <hi>To bring forth fruit in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Luke</hi> 8.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN the first of these three verses, the Apostle makes his first conjunction of Faith; Teaching, that as we must be of a sound belief, so of a virtuous life: The second of Knowledge, not to be drawn from a virtuous life by any deceits: Of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, against allurements: And Patience, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst terrors and troubles; all these are moral virtues: And to these he joynes in the third verse, the threefold train of Godlinesse, Brotherly love, and Charity; all which are theological virtues. For as Christ exhorteth, not only
<hi>to doe good to them, from whom we receive good, Luke</hi> the sixt chapter and the thirty third verse; which be the virtues of kindnesse, that the Heathen pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised; but to add Christian virtues, <hi>Doing good to them that hurt us;</hi> and as <hi>Matthew</hi> the sixt chapter, <hi>Our righteousnesse must exceed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Scribes and Pharisees:</hi> So theological virtues doe not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude moral; but, as the Apostle shews, we
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> beside moral virtues
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> these theological: <hi>Faith doth not abolish, but establish the Law;</hi> so, <hi>Romans</hi> the third chapter, the Gospel requires of a Christian, both will virtues and theological.</p>
               <p>In the course of the world we finde it otherwise, the civil man will shew himself temperate and patient, but makes little account
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:62585:343"/>of religious virtues. Others, as <hi>Jude</hi> the first verse, <hi>will seem to be religious,</hi> by hearing and discoursing of the word, and by certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious terms, but neglect those moral duties. According to the first table they are religious, but neglect the duty of the second.</p>
               <p>Therefore for the Civil man, albeit moral virtues are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this life; yet if he look higher to the great and pretious promises, <hi>of being partaker of the divine nature,</hi> his moral virtues can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not raise him up so high as those virtues of Christianity, that must doe that. And for them that stop at the moral duties of the second Table, and content themselves with a shewing religion by theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical virtues, <hi>If any man seem to be religious</hi> in such sort, <hi>his religion is vain,</hi> except he add moral, <hi>James</hi> the first chapter and the twenty sixt verse, <hi>That he refrain his tongue and keep himself unspotted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, For the order or method of the Apostle.</p>
               <p>There is an order, not only of things productive one of another, but that are adductive. And having already gone through the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the soul, that is, Reason, Affection, and Corruption; and prescribed internal virtues, Knowledge, Temperance, and Patience: Now he comes to the outward man, and shews, That to God, who is above us, is due <hi>Godlinesse;</hi> to them that are neer us, that is, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and spiritual brethren, that have one Father, <hi>Brotherly love;</hi> and to them that are farre off, that is, all men, <hi>Charity. Godlinesse</hi> is required in respect of the divine nature;
<hi>Brotherly love,</hi> in respect of the familiarity, or Church, which are the houshold of Faith, that is kindnesse, to be shewed to Christians; Thirdly,
<hi>Charity</hi> is a duty to be extended to all, both Jews and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as well as to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For as <hi>John</hi> the first chapter and the thirteenth verse, there is
<hi>the will of the flesh, and the will of man,</hi> whereunto Temperance and Patience have respect: So there is the will of God too, and that is it that Godlinesse takes hold of: The want of Patience to bear, made <hi>Peter</hi> to deny Christ: And therefore first he must be patient, and next after will follow Godlinesse; <hi>All that will live godly must suffer affliction,</hi> the second epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> the third chapter. So when we are armed with patience, we are fit to hear of Godlinesse. So it was with <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest; of whom it is reported, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this virtue, <hi>ibant gaudentes, Acts</hi> the fift chapter; having first planted patience, godlinesse follows by good consequence. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Godlinesse is that virtue, whereby we are affected towards God, as the worldly mans is to wordlinesse, or the fleshly man to carnal pleasure. <hi>Cornelius</hi> is called
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> the tenth chapter; and <hi>Acts</hi> the seventeenth chapter and the twenty third verse, it is used for the worship of God, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. If we ask, as <hi>Elias,</hi> to whom God is God; One hath his belly for his God,
<hi>Philippians</hi> the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; such a one was <hi>Esau,</hi> therefore called, <hi>a prophane person, Hebrews</hi> the twelfth chapter: Others have no other godlinesse <hi>but gain,</hi> as the first epistle to

               <p>The second Virtue is, <hi>love of brethren:</hi> For as in the Law he goes from the first Table to the second; so here having noted what is due to God, he prescribes us duties to be performed unto men. So the Gospel, as well as the Law, commands both purity and charity; and we must take the ground of our love, <hi>ex fonte puritatis; God makes his Sunne to rise upon the just and unjust, Matthew</hi> the fist chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; So must we shew, not only
<hi>brotherly love</hi> to Christians, but <hi>charity</hi> to all men. Which
<hi>brotherly love,</hi> is not to be extended to natural brethren, as
<hi>Matthew</hi> the twelfth chapter, <hi>My brothers and sisters are they which hear the word, and keep it:</hi> this is to be shewed to the Church, and for such which have one father and one elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Some forsake the fellowship, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 10. <hi>they are filii hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postoles, they withdraw themselves from the fraternity;</hi> but <hi>towards such as continue in the faith, let brotherly love continue, Hebrews</hi> the thirteenth chapter, and the first epistle of <hi>Peter,</hi> the first chapter and the twenty second verse, <hi>They that are faithfull, are called a brotherhood,</hi> the second epistle of <hi>Peter,</hi> the fist chapter; and therefore to them must this brotherly love be extended. This love must be without hypocrisie; not to say, as <hi>James</hi> the second chapter, <hi>If thy brother starve, and thou say depart and be warm, but minister not to him, what faith and godlinesse is that?</hi> So for Charity, the first epistle of <hi>John</hi> the third chapter, <hi>Love must not be in word and tongue, but in deed and truth.</hi> That is true charity, when we doe good to the fraternity; not that of the world, or after the flesh but of the Church.</p>
               <p>Concerning which, you need not that I write; for you are taught of God, who said, <hi>By this shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if you love one another, John</hi> the eleventh chapter. From hence he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth to Charity, exhorting us to shew love, not only <hi>quia sunt,</hi> but <hi>ut sunt;</hi> As to the faithfull, because they are brethren; but to all men generally, that they may be wonne to be of the Church. We must love,
<hi>Inimicum in Deo, &amp; inimicum propter Deum.</hi>

                  </gap> that is true love. As he begun with Faith, so he endeth with love, <hi>which is the bond of perfection, Colossians</hi> the third chapter, and keeps in all the other virtues.

               <p>Touching the end, <hi>fuga corruptionis,</hi> and <hi>the partaking of the Divine nature,</hi> are the two things we have looked unto in all the other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. The cause of our corruption is <hi>amor corruptionis</hi> in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and valuation; but it is refined by charity. Love is <hi>Charitas,</hi> of dearenesse, we set a great price of that which is most deare: And so if we make greatest account of God, we will love him above all things. If we set our love on that which is most deare, we shall eschue corruption. Secondly, <hi>The partaking of the Divine nature,</hi> is
<hi>to be like to him,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>John,</hi> the third chapter; and love is the greatest representation of the divine nature. In the other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues we doe but dispose our souls to be partakers of it. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, <hi>Deus est Charitas,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>John,</hi> the fourth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If then we be possessed of love, we shall be possessed of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature. Love is it that makes us <hi>adherere Deum, Psalm</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty third: <hi>Fides videt, spes tendit,</hi> but charity possesseth.

<pb n="640" facs="tcp:62585:345"/>Against the crosses that befall us in this life, the ordinary comfort is, the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the tenth chapter, <hi>Nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls us, but is such as pertaineth to man;</hi> but this was not any other mans case. And whereas there is none so hard-hearted, but will shew some relief, at least pitie a man in distresse, here was none touched with any compassion.</p>
               <p>For the verse it self, it is the Prophets speech in the person of the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> lamenting the miseries that happened at the death of <hi>Josiah;</hi> but by the rule of reciprocation, whereby that which is said of the members, may be applyed to the head; as was said to
<hi>Saul</hi> by Christ, <hi>why persecutest thou me?</hi> where it was the Church that was persecuted, <hi>Acts</hi> the ninth chapter, it is otherwise to be expounded. If any member, then especially of them under the Law, <hi>Quibus ad contingebunt in figuris,</hi> the first epistle to the
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> the tenth chapter: therefore <hi>Isaacs</hi> sacrifice,
<hi>Josephs</hi> sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by his brethren, and <hi>Davids</hi> betraying, who were particular members of the Church, were types and figures of Christs being
<hi>slain, sold,</hi> and <hi>betrayed.</hi> If the eyes, or hand, or footsuffer, the head also suffers with it; much more may the sufferings of the whole body together be applyed to the head, as <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my sonne,</hi> that being a place of the deliverance of Israel, <hi>Gods first borne, Colossians</hi> the eleventh chapter, is applyed to Christ,
<hi>Matthew</hi> the second chapter. And according to this rule, this verse is by the ancient Fathers applyed to the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and sufferings of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ.</p>
               <p>Whether it be the Cities speech, or any other whosoever, it may well be the speech of Christ on the Cross, that he was then in that great extremity, which none ever indured the like; and yet being without cause, none vouchsafed to look at him. That is the drift of the words, and is set down first by way of complaint, <hi>Have ye no regard?</hi> Secondly, by way of petition, <hi>Mark and regard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Passion two things are to be considered, first the grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his sufferings, noted in these words, <hi>If ever there were the like sorrow;</hi> Secondly, the cause of it in these, <hi>Where with the Lord hath afflicted me.</hi> Upon which follow these three actions: First, to see: Secondly, to consider: Thirdly, to regard and esteem of it, as a thing which concerns us.</p>
               <p>As is implyed in the first words, which are thus read, <hi>Nonne ad vos pertinet,</hi> for the first point, here is some spectacle to behold, in as much as he directeth his speech to them that passe by the way, <hi>Omnes qui transitis viam.</hi> When a stay is made, not of one, but of all, there is some great matter: and the holy Ghost tells us, that there is no journy so important, nor haste so great, that should hinder us from considering of the sufferings of Christ. The motives that he useth to quicken our weaknesse, are two, the one taken from the thing it self; the other from the beholders. For the thing it self, we know those things that are rare, draw our eyes to behold them; therefore he saith, <hi>If ever there were sorrow like my sorrow:</hi> And this<pb n="641" facs="tcp:62585:345"/>reason he takes from the beholders; as, Doth it not concern or pertain to you? For the things that were shewed, chiefly are such as concern us: as for other things that appertain unto us, we respect them not. The sufferings consist as all other doe, either <hi>in sensu</hi> or
<hi>damno,</hi> that is, either privatively or positively. That which is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated sorrow or prayer, is a blow or wound, which is a matter of sense; and it signifies such a blow as strikes off both root and leaves: that is it we are to consider in this spectacle. That which he felt, was either in body or soul.</p>
               <p>Touching his bodily sufferings, our own eyes are witnesses: For there was no part of him, neither skin, nor bone, nor sense, nor any part, wherein he was not stricken: His blessed body was an Anvile to receive all the stroaks that were laid on him. And we have no better argument hereof than
<hi>Pilates Ecce homo, John</hi> the nineteenth chapter; for he thought they had brought him to that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> already that even the hard-hearted Jews would have pitied him. But that which is said here, <hi>si fuerit dolor sicut,</hi> is not so verified of his bodily sufferings, as in that which he suffered in his soul: For in bodily sufferings many have been equall to him; but the suffering of the soul is most grievous, as the greatest heavinesse is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinesse of the heart: the afflictions of the body may be sustein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <hi>a wounded spirit who can bear? Proverbs</hi> the eighteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Therefore <hi>St. Paul</hi> calls that suffering which he felt in his soul, <hi>corpus mortis, Romans</hi> the seventh chapter: Upon these sufferings it is that he cryeth out, <hi>Ecce, si fuerit dolor sicut:</hi> The grievousnesse of whose suffering we argue not so much from that which is recorded of him, that he did

But it was not so with our Saviour; there was a sequestration, whereby the influence of his divinity was restrained from his humanity, whereupon ensued that cry, <hi>My God, why hast thou for saken me?</hi> there was never the like cry. Thirdly, From the party that complaineth, we may argue, there was never the like sorrow: A little thing done to a person of great excellencie, doth aggravate the matter; but never the like person suffered, and never the like sorrow,
<hi>Exodus</hi> 23. 3.

                  <hi>Verè hic salis est Deus;</hi> this makes it a cause not to be matched. The cause of those his sufferings is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to the bloody Soldiers, or hard-hearted Jews, or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Priests &amp; Scribes, but <hi>afflixit Deus.</hi> When God doth as well chasten in wrath, as christen in his displeasure, this is not don in his mercifull chastisement, but in his wrathfull displeasure, <hi>in die furoris ejus,</hi> nay his colour was red. When God is angry, or punisheth grievously, it is for some grievous sinne, and is for some notable sinne, of which it may be said <hi>non sicut,</hi> had our Saviour deserved the wrath of God in such manner. <hi>Pilate</hi> confesseth, <hi>He found nothing in him, John</hi> the fourteenth chapter and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

He that took not a penny was made to pay for all: That is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of surety ship; he undertaking to be our surety, our debt became his. It is a pityfull thing to see a Lamb have his throat cut; but if he will be a Sacrifice, it must be so. Christ undertook to be our Surety, to be a Sacrifice to God for our sinnes; therefore he was wounded for our sinnes,
<hi>By his stripes we are healed; Posuit Deus super eum iniquitates omnes nostras, Isaiah</hi> the fifty third chapter. That stroak that brought forth that bloody sweat, and the forsaking that brought forth that cry, should have light upon us.</p>
               <p>The parts to us. <hi>Have we no regard?</hi> Had it not concerned us, as a thing for our benefit, yet we ought to have had compassion, and not only as unsensible Creatures; for at the time of Christs suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the rocks and stones clave, and <hi>the vaile of the Temple was rent,</hi>
                  <pb n="643" facs="tcp:62585:346"/>
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> the twenty seventh chapter: Thus were the insensible Creatures moved at his sufferings, and men not moved a whit. Our Saviour sheweth, that albeit he felt such a great blow; yet neither the sense of his sufferings, nor his being bereft of all comfort, did grieve him so much as this, That we have no regard of it; therefore followeth this petition,
<hi>Mark now;</hi> though heretofore ye have had no regard, yet now <hi>behold it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It consists of three points: First, to see, He was as the brasen Serpent, let up, <hi>that all men should cast up their eyes;</hi> so he saith,
<hi>John</hi> the twelfth chapter, <hi>If I were lift up I will draw all men to me.</hi> Secondly, To see, and not to consider, is a folly: to see and look with gazing, is that which the Angels found fault with, <hi>Acts</hi> the first chapter: We must not only <hi>look to Jesus, the Author and finisher of our faith, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> the twelfth chapter; but, as it followeth,
<hi>recogitate:</hi> think on him again and again, what great things he suffered, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort he was bereft of, <hi>He that had suffered was the sonne of God, Hebrews</hi> the second chapter, and he suffered for us. Consider the love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Christ was moved to suffer this for us; and the benefit that comes to us from his passion: he being an innocent, there was no necessity for him to dye; and having <hi>guards of Angels,</hi> as <hi>Matthew</hi> the twenty sixt chapter, he could not be compelled to suffer; but he did it willingly: He first made him a body fit to suffer, and then
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that body for us; and that was love, and never the like love, whether we respect God or Christ. God gave his only Sonne; no greater benefit could be given us, then that. Christs love appears to us, by his obedience to his Father: His love to us is shewed, that for us, he that was the greatest person that ever was, <hi>became obedient to death, even of the Crosse;</hi> that he suffered not only a shamefull, but cursed death, <hi>Factus est maledictum, Galatians</hi> the third chapter; for
<hi>cursed is every one that hangeth on tree:</hi> Never was there the like love; his very death had been sufficient for our redemption: For it is God himself that offered this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and this he did to make us consider his love, <hi>Si fuerit amor sicut.</hi> But in regard of the benefit that comes to us, his death is our restament, whereby we come to an inheritance; the day of wrath to him, is our day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and jubile; his stripes, our medicine; his for saking, our receiving to favour. Thus are we to consider his sufferings, in respect of the fruit that comes to us by it: We are to have a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie, as also to conceive an antipathie against sinne.</p>
               <p>The cause of his grievous passion, we must shew it, pertains to us, not only by looking and thinking on it, but by doing something, as

               <p>WHICH words present to us, First, the Christians, to whom the Apostle wrote this Epistle, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently our selves under the term of
<hi>Sheep.</hi> Secondly, our Saviour Christ, who is the <hi>pastor</hi> and
<hi>Shepheard,</hi> as he affirms of himself, <hi>John</hi> the tenth chapter,
<hi>I am the true Shepheard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which concerns us, doth set out a double state: First,
<hi>That we were as sheep going a stray:</hi> Secondly, <hi>As sheep converted.</hi> The one is our estare, wherein we were before our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; the other our estate after conversion. The one is a state of misery endlesse; the other of felicity without end.</p>
               <p>In the treaty whereof, three things are offered, First, the term of <hi>Sheep,</hi> applyed to our selves. Secondly, <hi>Shepheard,</hi> with the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it to Christ. Thirdly, our <hi>error</hi> and
<hi>conversion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, For the term of <hi>Sheep,</hi> there is no name so often borrowed to expresse the state of Mankinde; whereof, besides the application which the Apostle makes of it here, we have a plain exposition, in
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> the thirty fourth chapter, <hi>&amp; hae omnes homines sant.</hi> Of these terms that are found in the Scripture applyed to Christian men, there are two especially: The first of Plants, Thereby Christ chuseth the Vine: The second of Living Creatures, sheep. They are both, <hi>Psalm</hi> the eightieth, <hi>Thou hast brought a Vine out of Egypt;</hi> and for the other,
<hi>Thou that leadest Joseph like a Sheep.</hi> And so in the new Testament, the state of the Church compared to a <hi>Sheep-fold, John</hi> the tenth chapter; and <hi>John</hi> the fifteenth chapter, <hi>to a Vine.</hi> The congruities between the Church and these terms are many, but that which is specially here to be observed, is the need of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Shepheard. The Vine is the weakest of all other Plants, and must be raised up against the house side, or else it will not prosper, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the fifteenth chapter: So for Sheep, they are weak and of small strength. For their wisdome, there is no Creature so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

To these we add a third point, that is, no Creature hath so many enemies. So it is with the Church; As they are Sheep, they have Theeves and Robbers, <hi>John</hi> the tenth chapter: As they are like the Vine, <hi>there is the wild Boar out of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Psalm</hi> the eightieth. Whatsoever is weak of it self, and bath many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, hath need of help from another: So that if there be a Theef and Wolf <hi>quem
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<hi>ad quem confugere debent.</hi> If the Wolfe doe <hi>disgregare</hi> and

                     </gap>,</hi> there must be one that will <hi>congregare Oves.</hi> If to be scattered be a misery, the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<pb n="645" facs="tcp:62585:347"/>against that is, to be in the unity of a flock; and the way to be delivered from being a pray, is to be under the defence of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard. The one is the wisdom, the other is the strength of this poor Creature. Then to erre from the Fold and Shepheard, is the only evil that can be fall them; so the Prophet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> the ninth chapter, our Saviour describes the misery of the people, to shew them,
<hi>that they were as Sheep without a Shepheard.</hi> If to erre be a misery, then our felicity stands, either in staying in the Fold, or, if we be gone astray, to return to the Shepheard, that is, to Christ, who promiseth life, and aboundance of life, to him that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth unto him, the tenth chapter of
<hi>St. Johns</hi> Gospel, and the tenth verse.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the term of <hi>Shepheard</hi> and
<hi>Bishop,</hi> it is applyed to Christ by Congregation, being a flock. Every Governor is a Shepheard, not only in regard of the state of the Church, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Common-wealth: For it is first applyed to <hi>Joseph,</hi> who was a politick Magistrate, <hi>Genesis</hi> the fourty ninth chapter; so to

                  </gap>, and not only so, but as it followeth, they are <hi>Pastores animarum:</hi> For seeing men are reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creatures, God forbid but a Magistrate should have a greater regard of men, than rural Shepheards of Sheep that are <hi>pecora

                  </hi> the the fift chapter, the mount of God, from whence came the Law: But here is Gods own hill from whence came the Gospel. As the term <hi>Shepheard,</hi> so is <hi>Pastor, Ezekiel</hi> the thirty fourth chapter and the eighteenth verse, to tread on the good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures; and drink of the deep waters. These are applyed to the state Civil, as <hi>Psalm</hi> the twenty third and the second verse, <hi>The Lord is my Shepheard, he maketh me to rest on green
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to the still waters.</hi> But as these terms are applyed to the Common-wealth; so also the Church is a flock, and the Shepheard is Christ. All that came before him were but theeves, as he saith, <hi>I am the true Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard;</hi> and therefore it is more excellently applyed to him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to any other: For no Shepheard can say of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>All we, like sheep, have gane astray, and turned every one to his own way, Isaiah</hi> the fifty third chapter.

               <p>THEY be the words of Christ, spoken to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to comfort them, being in heavinesse, because Christ was to be taken from them, verse the sixth; for here is matter of double sorrow. For first <hi>That they should not see him:</hi> Secondly, That he was to goe such a journey from them. But there is a double comfort answerable. The comfort of not seeing him is, <hi>after a while ye shall see me:</hi> The comfort against his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, <hi>that he goeth to his Father.</hi> The words in effect are as much as if he said, within a while I shall suffer death upon the Crosse, and be buried; and within a while after, I shall arise again, and ascend up to my Father, which is a special matter of comfort and rejoycing, as <hi>John</hi> the fourteenth chapter and the twenty eighth verse, <hi>If ye lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, ye would rejoyce, because I said, I goe to my Father:</hi> They knew not what he meant by those words, verse the eighteenth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour maketh a commentary on them, verse the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, <hi>ye shall not see me,</hi> that is, ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoyce: <hi>And again, ye shall see me,</hi> that is, your sorrow shall be turned into laughter and joyes. Again, he makes it more plain with a comparison, verse the twenty first, <hi>non videbitis;</hi> that shall be to you as the pangs of a woman labouring with childe; <hi>and ye shall see me,</hi> that is like the joy she conceiveth after her deliverance. For the first point he saith, verse the fourth, he did not tell them of his departure from the beginning, nor yet a great while before his passion, but only now; that is some diminishing of their grief. But in the second point there is much more comfort; that is, albeit he must be taken from them, yet they shall not only see him again, but very shortly after. The vision that is for many dayes,

                  </gap> us to long and thirst after the accomplishment of it; but Christ cells them, they shall see him again, and that very shortly. The same course he keeps in the reason; for he saith,
<hi>quia vado,</hi> not to the crosse and passion, that was not a matter so pleasing, but <hi>ad Patrem,</hi> that is it that doth increase their joy. Wherein we are to observe Christs method of comfort, not to minister comfort before the time.</p>

The personal object is the more comfortable. But in the person many things make it more desirous: As to see a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whom we love, and who loveth us, that is a sight of comfort: So was it a great joy to <hi>Jacob,</hi> to see <hi>Joseph, Genesis</hi> the fourty sixt chapter; such is the joy of the Spouse to see Christ,
<hi>Canticles</hi> the sixth chapter. Touching Christs love, himself saith,
<hi>John</hi> the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter, <hi>Majorem hac charitatem habet nemo;</hi> he loved us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his enemies. If then the view of a man be comfortable, what shall we say of the fight of God, that must needs be

<hi>The pure in heart shall be blessed, quia videbit Deum, Matthew</hi> the fift chapter: That was it that made <hi>Philip</hi> say, <hi>John</hi> the fourteenth chapter, <hi>Ostende nobis Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem, &amp; sufficit.</hi> But he that seeth Christ, seeth God the Father, as he saith, <hi>He that seeth me, seeth the Father.</hi> When <hi>Moses</hi> desired God <hi>to shew him his glory, Exodus</hi> the thirty third chapter: though he shewed but his back parts, yet it was so glorious a sight, that they that beheld <hi>Moses</hi> face, <hi>saw the skin shine, Exocus</hi> the thirty fourth chapter, so that he was fain to cover it. And, as in the second epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the third chapter, <hi>we are transformed into his image:</hi> Christ in his corruptible nature being transfigured in the presence of his Disciples, was so glorious, that they desired they might goe no more home, <hi>Matthew</hi> the seventeenth chapter: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the fight of Gods presence be a matter of so great joy,
<hi>non videbitis</hi> must needs be occasion of great sorrow: Which is exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in <hi>Adam;</hi> who having sinned, though he were in Paradise, a place of all comfort; yet he had no joy, because he could not see God, as he was wont: Therefore <hi>Cain</hi> complaineth, <hi>I am cast out of thy presence, Genesis</hi> the fourth chapter: And not only the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, but
<hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psalm</hi> the thirty first and the twenry second verse, <hi>I said in my haste, I am cast out of thy presence,</hi> or fight: which shewed, that as <hi>videbitis</hi> must be the persection of all felicity; so <hi>non videbitis</hi> is the summe of all misery; especially if it be not qualified with <hi>modicum, Psalm</hi> the thirteenth, <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever?

               <p>Secondly, We are to inquire, what manner of sight he speaketh of, for as much as men see not only with bodily eyes, but with the eyes of understanding. They that with their bodily eyes beheld Christ before his Passion, and after his Resurrection, did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, <hi>Luke</hi> the twenty fourth chapter and the eleventh verse. As there is an outward light, so an inward light of the minde, into which the doctrine of the Gospel doth shine, the second epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the fourth chapter, as the light of the Sunne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to our outward sense. There are things that cannot be seen of the bodily eyes, <hi>which we doe yet behold and look on with the eye of faith,</hi> the second epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the fourth chapter: and <hi>Moses</hi> is said <hi>to have loved God invisible, Hebrews</hi> the eleventh chapter. So the bad qualities of men, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are invisible to the outward eye; but yet we see it by the light of our understanding. Such a sight is that which he promiseth, <hi>John</hi> the fourteenth chapter, <hi>I will make my self manifest to him.</hi> He shewed himself to <hi>Judas</hi> as well as to <hi>Peter</hi> bodily: But as it was a special touch, wherewith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But even this spiritual sight hath also a deceit, as, in the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the thirteenth chapter, <hi>Now we see through a glasse, but then face to face:</hi> So there are two words to that purpose,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> is to see a thing as it is. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels doe continually behold Gods face; we have but an enigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall sight of him in this life, and it is soon lost; as Christ being ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen from death, was seen of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and others, in the habit of a Gardiner: To them that travelled to <hi>Emaus,</hi> at one time they did see him, and at another time they could not see him.</p>
               <p>Touching which, he that shall consider the desire which the Saints of God have of this benefit, shall easily perceive what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of sorrow it was; for <hi>Psalm</hi> the ninety second, <hi>My soul is a thirst for the living God; Psalm</hi> the eighty fourth it saith. <hi>For the City of my God;</hi> again, <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, for ever?</hi> but
<hi>modicum, &amp; videbitis,</hi> that gives comfort again. <hi>Heavinesse may endure for a night,</hi> that is <hi>modicum, &amp; non videbitis; but joy commeth in the morning,</hi> that is <hi>modicum, &amp; videbitis, Psalme</hi> the thirtieth. <hi>The delaying of hope is the fainting of the heart, Proverbs</hi> the eighteenth chapter, but <hi>the desire accomplished is the tree of life. Modicum, &amp; videbitis,</hi> is as the tree of life, that quickens the sool, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the sixty fourth chapter, <hi>For a moment in my anger I forsake them, but with great compassion will I gather them.</hi>

Therefore as a woman tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth in sorrow, but being delivered, is glad, <hi>quia natus est homo.</hi> So by my death there is a new nativity, and you are to be glad, that by me you are made the children of God, that is, by my going away to the Father.</p>
               <p>For the Use, as Christ saith of himself, <hi>non videbitis,</hi> and again, <hi>modicum, &amp; videbitis;</hi> that is, verse the twentieth,
<hi>re shall weep and lament, and the world shall rejoyce.</hi> We are to reckon of the things and persons of this life, that is truly said of the

               </p>
               <p>The Cause is double, First, <hi>Their inventions:</hi> Secondly,

<hi>Phinehas</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Secondly, <hi>He stood up</hi> in the cause.</p>
               <p>The first thing to be set down is, That sicknesse and mortality of people is causall, and not casuall; for nothing is more contrary than Chance or Fortune, and Judgement. For seeing a sparrow cannot light on the ground, without Gods providence, such is Gods care for them, though <hi>two of them be sold for a farthing, Matthew</hi> the tenth chapter, it is a senselesse thing to think that ficknesse can befall a man by chance. Therefore the Philistims, being plagued by God would try whether that disease came of Gods hand, or by chance, the first book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the sixth chapter and the ninth verse. But the very name of plague signifying originally judgement, shews it is no casual thing, as in the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter, where he saith, <hi>They did eat and drink their own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that is, <hi>that many were sick among them, and many

<hi>Corinth,</hi> was Gods judgement: and so the Latin word <hi>plaga,</hi> being a stripe, sheweth the same. If a stripe, there is a striker: so then, they are not casual. If a Surgeon, Physician, or Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, were to give a reason hereof, he will impute the cause to the infection of the aire, the putrefaction of the bodies by humors, and to conversing one with another; and they are good causes of it: For so saith God, <hi>Exodus</hi> the ninth chapter and the tenth verse, <hi>Mases took the ashes of the furnace, and cast them up in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But as the cause of the plague is not only natural, so here is used a spiritual remedy; that is, in as much as contrary,
<hi>curantur contrariis viis.</hi> If the provoking of Gods anger be the Cause of the plague, the appeasing of it by prayer must be the Remedy. The two remedies are out of the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sense of the word, which signifieth prayer and punishing. Prayer is an appeaser of Gods wrath, not only in other points, but in this, <hi>Numbers</hi> the twenty fift chapter, <hi>They all wept and prayed:</hi> And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> in the second book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the twenty fourth chapter and the seventeenth verse, fled to this remedy, <hi>I have sinned, but these sheep what have they done?</hi> And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> being infected with the plague, <hi>turned himself to the wall, Isaiah</hi> the thirty eighth chapter: And in <hi>Salomons</hi> prayer, the first of the
<hi>Kings</hi> and the eighth chapter, where plagues, or corrupt agues shall hop, here then in heaven. And there is a good proportion between this remedy and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease: For if there be a corrupt smell, the way to take it away is by the good smell of incense or perfume. So, as our sinne doth give an evil savour, and stink in Gods nostrils; so the spiritual incense will remove it, and that incense is prayer, <hi>Psalm</hi> the fourty first: Therefore the prayers of the Saints are called <hi>odours, Apocalyps</hi> the fift chapter. But it must be prayer qualified in two sorts.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Phinehas</hi> prayer, that is, the prayer of the Priest. So <hi>David</hi> had <hi>Gad</hi> to pray for him; <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had <hi>Isaiah, Lift thou up thy prayer, Isaiah</hi> the thirty eighth chapter: The Corinthians had <hi>Gad</hi> to pray for them, the first epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> the eleventh chapter. The prayers of all the just are available, but specially of the elders, therefore send for them, <hi>James</hi> the fift chapter. A Serjeant, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, or Scrivener, by virtue of his office, may doe that which a greater man cannot doe; so the prayer of a person called to that holy function, may prevail more: The Priests are appointed to offer up prayers, and <hi>the calves of the lips, Hosea</hi> the fourteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So, <hi>Genesis</hi> the twentieth chapter, <hi>Abraham</hi> is a Prophet, and shall pray for thee, <hi>Leviticus</hi> the sixt chapter and the seventh verse: he shall pray for thee, <hi>Orabit pro eo Sacerdos:</hi> Therefore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> saith, <hi>Lift up thou thy prayers, Isaiah</hi> the thirty eighth chapter. And <hi>Saint</hi>
                  <pb n="656" facs="tcp:62585:353"/>
                  <hi>James</hi> saith in his fift chapter, The prayer of faith made by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders shall save the sick. The prayer of the just avails much, but especially of the elders and Priests; for to such a grace is given, as in the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the fifteenth chapter, <hi>Gratia data est <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> and this grace is not in vain.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But it must be <hi>oratio cum statione, Phinehas stood up and prayed.</hi> For, as in the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the eleventh chapter, of a woman uncovered, judge whether it be a comely thing to sit still in prayer. All things in the Church must be done

                  </gap>, the first epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the fourteenth chapter. We must please and serve God,
<hi>etiam habitu corporis. The Angels of God stood before God, Job</hi> the first chapter; <hi>The Cherubims stood and hid their faces, Isaiah</hi> the sixt chapter: And <hi>millions of Angels stood before the seat, Daniel</hi> the seventh chapter. Therefore we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude our sitting is not pleasing to God: <hi>Sedentes orare extra Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipulum est.</hi> The other sense is, the execution or judgement: And it hath a good relation to sinnes, <hi>They prayed and wept, Numbers</hi> the twenty fift chapter; but that prevailed not, till
<hi>Phinehas</hi> execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vengeance upon the sinne: but the vengeance being performed, by <hi>Phinehas, the plague ceased,</hi> verse the eighth. So then the wrath of God will cease, if people cease to sinne; or if <hi>Phinehas,</hi> the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi> begin to punish sinne in the people. For punishment is of two sorts: First, Every man in himself, is to punish sinne, as <hi>David smit his heart,</hi> in the second book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the twenty fift chapter and the twenty fourth verse; and the first epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> the eleventh chapter, <hi>judge your selves.</hi> But if not <hi>Moses,</hi> the Magistrate must take vengeance of sinne; for if he will not, <hi>God himself will set his face against that Magistrate, Leviticus</hi> the twentieth chapter. When the people look not at him that strikes them, but to natural causes, <hi>then shall the hand of God be stretched out still, Isaiah</hi> the ninth chapter and the thirteenth verse. The wrath of God for our sinnes being the cause of this plague, we must appease him with prayer and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. If we fail to doe this, the devotion of the Priest, and the zeal of the Magistrate, must look to it, else the plague cannot but still increase.</p>

               <p>These then being the two effectual means to attain to knowledge, there is no place in the Scripture, nor any book therein, that doth more lively expresse them both than this book of <hi>Genesis,</hi> which we have in hand: For it setteth out to us the word of God, by which all things were made,
<hi>fiet;</hi> and the Word by which all things are increased, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> sheweth us both, <hi>Matthew</hi> the sixteenth chapter, the seventh and eighth verses. It is the ancientest in time; for it beginneth with the very beginning: It is first in order and in place, in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Gods book; and therefore I have thought it good to enquire of this way. Some doe give this reason, why
<hi>John,</hi> of all other, is called the Divine, because he, of all others, began with the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all, <hi>John</hi> the first chapter. This order we see he took of <hi>Moses,</hi> who first telleth of things past, from the Creation till his death, and foretelleth of things which were to come to passe in the latter end, and which the new Testament doth say is fulfilled.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of both these things, past, and to come, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to shew to his Church, and after it must we seek, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the fourty first chapter and the twenty second verse: and these secrets are no where so fully shewed as by <hi>Moses</hi> in this book.</p>
               <p>If then we intend to get knowledge, and with that key to open Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dores, and to see the glorious Majestie of God, let us take this book in hand, which hath in it both leaves at large, both the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Creation of all Gods works, and the knowledge of the wisdome and the true word of God.</p>
               <p>But some may demand, What will become of Christ and of his Gospel, all this while that we are meditating of <hi>Moses</hi> and Gods works? I answer, That if <hi>Moses</hi> did not testifie and teach us of Christ, we would account the time lost which we spend in reading him,
<hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> the third chapter and the eighth verse; and we would leave <hi>Moses</hi> learning, that we might only finde Christ. But <hi>St. Paul</hi> doth assure us, <hi>Acts</hi> the third chapter and the eighteenth verse, that all the Prophets, from the beginning of the world, did speak of him; and among all the Prophets it is said, <hi>We have found him of whom Moses spake, John</hi> the first chapter and the fourty fift verse, <hi>even Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus the sonne of Joseph:</hi> And more plainly Christ saith, <hi>John</hi> the
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:62585:354"/>fift chapter and the fourty sixth verse, <hi>Moses doth write and testifie of me.</hi> And this we shall see plainly in all his books to be true, both in evident and direct Prophesies, and also in dark and mysticall types and figures.</p>
               <p>The second question is touching <hi>Moses</hi> himself, How he being but a man, could come to the knowledge of such secret things, which were hidden from other natural men besides, being superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and beyond mens reach? I answer, As we cannot have knowledg of a strange Country where we never were, but by report or by Letter, or relation sent from some which dwell therein; so we can have no notice or certain knowledge of God and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, unlesse God first by his letter written make relation thereof to us:
<hi>Has quidem literas dedit Deus, Moses attulit,</hi> God was the writer,
<hi>Moses</hi> the Messenger of these holy Writts; many things, no doubt, were taught by instruction, and received by tradition from the Patriarchs before, as wee see in the fift chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> and the twenty ninth verse; for so <hi>Lamech</hi> knew from his fathers, that the Earth was accursed by God, as it is in the eighteenth chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> and the twenty seventh verse: <hi>Abraham</hi> knew from his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, that he was made of dust and ashes, <hi>Adam</hi> leaving it to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity; as <hi>Abraham</hi> did teach his family, that God revealed to him, <hi>Genesis</hi> the eighteenth chapter and the ninteenth verse: But though many things came to knowledge by this meanes, yet <hi>de eo tempore scribere de quo non erat,</hi> is a strange matter, some may say; but wee answer, that this was done either knowing it by that pattern which hee saw in the Mount, or else by the voice and spirit of God speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and talking with him to teach him the so things, that is, hee must needs come by it by the Eye, that is, by vision, or else by the Eare, that is, by Revelation: For as all Scriptures came by inspiration, the first of
<hi>Peter</hi> and the first chapter, so

<hi>Daniel</hi> the second chapter and the twenty eighth verse, <hi>It is not I that can reveal secrets, but there is a God of Heaven which declareth them, Moses</hi> was but the pen of that God did speak. If any then shall move that question, <hi>Matthew</hi> the twenty first chapter and the twenty fift verse,

                  <hi>and rebellious men, Deuteronomie</hi> the ninth chapter and the ninth verse. And as none durst call his truth in question; so they which resisted, as
<hi>Korah</hi> and <hi>Dathan</hi> did, were grievously punished by the hand of God. And so were <hi>Appian</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> plagued for their blasphemy, which scoff and deride these holy Books. For so saith <hi>Moses</hi> to his accusers, <hi>Numbers</hi> the sixteenth chapter, the twenty eigth and twenty ninth verses, <hi>Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to speak these words, if these dye not the death of all men,</hi> &amp;c. Another reason to prove that his writings came from Heaven, is his Rod, and the miracles which God caused him to doe, to confirm these things which he spake and wrote; which miracles, even the Heathen Chronicles doe confesse to this day. Last of all, Mens writings and books savour of passions and imperfections incident to men. <hi>Moses</hi> is not, of self-love, partial to himself, nor vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, seeking any praise; For, in his writing, he spareth not his own Father: <hi>Exodus</hi> the thirty second chapter and the twenty seventh verse, he spareth not Idolatry in his brother, nor his sister <hi>Cozbies</hi> fault, no nor his own fault of unbelief; for which he confesseth, that he could not enter into the promised Land, <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> the thirty second chapter. Seeing then all that is of the flesh and earth is flesh, and savoureth earthly things; this sheweth that <hi>Moses</hi> writing came from Gods spirit. For
<hi>Moses</hi> in all the warres he waged, and in all the Laws he wrote, he never ascribeth any thing but to the glory of God, which gave them by his means, exhorting to nothing but this, That by holy obedience we should seek his praise.</p>
               <p>The conclusion therefore must be this, That seeing it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible word of God sent from Heaven, and not invented by men, Why doe we not then, with all reverence hear him, and with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence beleeve him, as a Prophet sent from God? especially seeing it is threatned concerning him by name, That whosoever doth not hear him, but despise him, He shall be cut off from the people of God.</p>

The Godly and the wicked doe both dye, and both are buried in the grave; the righteous shall have domination over them in the morning, <hi>but God shall save the soul of the righteous from the grave, Psalm</hi> the fourty ninth and the fifteenth verse.

<hi>afterward the rich man was tormented, and Lazarus for ever comforted, Luke</hi> the sixteenth chapter. So there is a resemblance of the resurrection in Gods works, before the same was expressed in his words. Now is the light mixed with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and darknesse with light: the darknesse of the night hath the light of the starres, and somtime the shining of the Moon; the light of the day is often overcast with the mist, or with clouds, but the morning of the resurrection shall be without end. The evening of condemnation to the wicked, shall never have morning; and the morning of glorification to the blessed shall never have evening. Untill that day of resurrection there shall be a mixture, but then, and not before, there shall be light without darknesse to the blessed, and endlesse darknesse, without light, to the damned. And thus much shall suffice concerning the first day, and the work of the first day.</p>

               <p>Touching which (besides the obedience of this Element, in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Gods Decree, we note a special Certificate under Gods hand as it were, for the discharge of this Creature, in the dispatch of his work, and that without delay, with all haste and speed: Which reproveth not only our disobedience to God, but also our dulnesse and slownesse in doing any thing which God commands. For with us it is one thing to doe a thing, and another to doe it willingly and quickly, with expedition and speed: For when God doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing, we put it off with this delay, <hi>erit sic,</hi> it shall be so hereafter, when we can finde leisure and fit time.

               <p>Secondly, In that the return, in the end of the eleventh verse, was <hi>erat sic, it was so,</hi> two things are to be noted out of the nature of the word: First, a congruity of the performance answerable to the commandement in every point; for here is specified just so much done as was required, nothing too much or too little, to teach us that our obedience must be such: We must not <hi>deficere in necessariis, nec abundare in superfluis.</hi> The other point is for continuance or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity; for the word signifieth, that it was so surely and firmly done, as if it had a sure basis or foundation for continuance, that it might never fail: we see it holdeth and endureth <hi>ad hunc usque diem,</hi> our eyes and experience seeing that it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Touching the Commandement we may note, That to say or to command in word may seem to be but a weak thing; for words we hold to be but winde; yet such words as God speaketh, doe receive such and so great power and authority from the Speaker or Commander, that of necessity that which is said must needs be done.</p>
               <p>If a King doe command, the power of his authority being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the weaknesse of his word, doth cause it to be very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and effectual. If a Princes authority can make his word so great,
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:62585:359"/>how much more can Gods omnipotencie give strength to his word, and cause that which he saith, to be most certainly done? This the reason, that by the virtue and force only of his word, what
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> faith is done and cometh to passe.</p>
               <p>The second thing to be noted, is to whom God spake, namely, to the Waters: For as <hi>Moses</hi> was willed to speak to the stony rock,
<hi>Numbers</hi> the twentieth chapter and the eighth verse; so doth God here speak to the waters; neither is it a fond thing thus for God to speak to deas and senselesse creatures; for though they have no cares and cannot heare, yet they can understand when God doth call and speak to them, and have power to doe his will when he commandeth. If then the waters and rocks can heare, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and doe what God doth say and bid them; how much more should we, which have eares, and understanding hearts, and active hands, take heed we doe the like?</p>
               <p>Now touching the Tenor of Gods precept, we see it concerneth the producing and bringing forth of living things in abundance and great multitude. And though God saith, <hi>Let the waters bring forth fowles,</hi> it argueth not (as <hi>Symplicius</hi> the Atheist absurdly gathereth) that here the water is said to be the matter of which the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> were made; for in the second chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and the ninteenth verse, this is explained, that they were made of the earth, though they were brought forth of the waters.</p>
               <p>Touching the creatures moving in the waters, the word here u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed doth, in a generall term, signifie such things as are quick, and live, and move, comprehending therein all the particular creatures besides fish or fowle, which either creep or crawle or move in either of these elements, as Froggs, Snakes, Flyes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Man by practice can attain to the Fishes motion, that is, to swim and move upon, and in the waters; but he cannot by any devise at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to fly, and move as Birds, or mount in the ayre. It is a wonder to heare that iron could swimme, in the second of <hi>Kings</hi> the sixt chapter and the sixt verse; but it is by the same power of God, by which a feather can fly aloft.</p>
               <p>By the firmament or Aire is meant the nether and grosser part of the aire, which region is full of foggy fumes and vapours which come from the earth; and so high and farre the sowls can abide and endure to flie: But the farther and higher part and region of the aire, which is more pure and cleer, are called <hi>penetralia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> which is so free from grosse vapours and earthly mists, that no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing can breath or abide therein: As therefore Water is a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> element for Fishes, which breath not; so this lower region of the aire is for all Fowls.</p>
               <p>But let us come to that which is common both to fish and fowls, and maketh both of them live and move, the one by swimming, the other by flying, and that is the soul of life. Concerning which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, It signifieth a breath or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> and, as we have heard, it hath three branches.</p>
               <p>That which we are to consider in this Sentence, is first, That he is condemned to be under the curse of God: Secondly, <hi>To creep upon his belly:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>To eat the dust all the dayes of his life.</hi> Which three punishments are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to that three fold fault which the Serpent committed, and whereunto he perswaded our Parents, that was the sinne first of Malice; Secondly, of Pride; Thirdly, of intemperate desire, to eat of that which was forbidden. The Curse of God hath relation to the Serpents malice; the creeping upon his belly, was inflicted as a punishment for his pride, and the feeding upon the dust, hath a correspondencie with his inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate desire. These three sinnes are necessarily to be considered, that considering how God hath plagued them in the Devil, we should beware that we fall not into the like sinnes.</p>
               <p>Touching the Curse of God, As it is the first, so the greatest part of this Sentence; And is a punishment most fearfull; for all men doe abhorre to be cursed, and to incurre the displeasure of a man, much more of God, whose word is his deed; so that he no sooner speaks, but it is done.
<hi>Jacob</hi> was loth to doe any thing to deceive his Father, <hi>because so,</hi> saith he, <hi>I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing, Genesis</hi> the twenty seventh chapter. Indeed, as the Wise-man speaks, the curse that is causelesse and proceeds from foolish people shall not light upon a man, <hi>Proverbs</hi> the twenty sixt chapter and the second verse. But if a godly man, such as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> were, doe curse, it shall not fail but come to passe: Much more shall the curse of God take effect;
<hi>for it shall come into a mans bowels like water, and like oyle into his bones, Psalm</hi> the hundred and ninth, the seventeenth verse. For the meaning of this Curse, the Holy Gohst hath set down a large commentary, in <hi>

                  </hi> the twenty eighth chapter, and in <hi>Leviticus</hi> the twenty sixt chapter; and the Prophet saith Gods curse is <hi>a flying book, twenty cubits long, and ten cubits braad, containing the curse that gotth over the whole earth,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> the fift chapter and the third verse: <hi>It is a book written within and without, with lamentations, mournings and woes, Ezekiel</hi> the<pb n="673" facs="tcp:62585:361"/>second chapter. By these places it appeareth how large Gods Curse is, in respect of this life: But if with this we joyn that which Christ addeth concerning the life to come, that is, <hi>everlasting fire prepared for the Devill and his Angels, Matthew</hi> the twenty fift chapter, his curse will appear to be farre more large.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is no malediction but in regard of some evill: The evill that procured this curse unto the Devill, was the evill of his malice which he shewed, not only in speaking evill of God, but in seeking to destroy man both in body and soul: And his malice appears herein, because he did those things, being not provoked thereunto, and for that he did it without any

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to himself.</p>
               <p>As the Devill is malicious, so are all they that are of that evill one: <hi>Cain</hi> had no other cause to hate his Brother, and to slay him, but because his works were righteous and his own evill, in the first epistle of <hi>John,</hi> the third chapter and the twelfth verse. The

                  </gap> persecuted Christ, not for any evill that they found in him worthy of death, but only of envy, <hi>Mark</hi> the fifteenth chapter, and the tenth verse. Thus to sinne of malice, is a thing so displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing unto God, as, albeit he did in mercy forgive men, when they sinned through frailty, yet he will punish their own inventions, <hi>Psalm</hi> the ninty ninth, and the eighth verse; and therefore against such the Prophet prayeth, <hi>Be not mercifull to those that offend of malicious wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Psalm</hi> the fifty ninth and the fifth verse, <hi>But consume them utterly in thy wrath, that they may perish,</hi> verse the thirteenth. Where the Lord saith, <hi>Cursed art thou</hi> [and not be thou] he sheweth, that the curse commeth not from God, but from the Devils malice; and so whatsoever misery betideth us, it is nothing else but the spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of our own sinnes,
<hi>Job</hi> the fift chapter and the ninth verse; and as the Psalmist saith,

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               <p>In that God speaks by way of comparison, (<hi>Cursed art thou
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     </gap> upon him, Daniel</hi> the ninth chapter and the eleventh verse. And that this curse was verified in the visible Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, appears hereby, that not only Men, but even all beasts, doe shun the Serpent, as a Creature principally accursed of God; much more it is true in the invisible Serpent the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for not only the godly, but even the wicked that are of their Father the Devill
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> stick to curse him. The visible Serpent, being an unreasonable<pb n="674" facs="tcp:62585:362"/>creature, could not be so malicious: But the invisible Serpent, the more policie he hath, the more pernitious and hurtfull he is; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he is so malicious, that as he himself is fallen from his first estate, and hath plunged himself in the bottom of Hell, so he laboureth to bring all men into the same estate: therefore thus was his malice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
               <p>Now to the two other branches of this Sentence, where we shall finde two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> punishments for two sorts of sinnes; for pride must have a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and lust must loath; and we shall see that they are both rewarded accordingly, as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith
<hi>That Pride goeth before deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Proverbs</hi> the sixteenth chapter and the eighth verse: So the Devil, having
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> himself, must be thrown down to creep upon the ground; for it is great equity, that he that would fly, should creep: And, as it was meet, <hi>that glory should end in shame, Philippians</hi> the third chapter; so is it as meet, that God should punish inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate last with loathsomnesse. And this is the course of Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, as the Wise-man saith in <hi>Proverbs</hi> the twentieth chapter and the seventeenth verse, <hi>The bread that is gotten by deceipt is sweet, but at the last it will fill the mouth with gravel.</hi> All the sinnes of the world may he reduced to these two, that is, The desire of greater glory than God hath appointed to us, And, of greater pleasure than is lawfull for us.</p>
               <p>First, we are to inquire, How the first of these two punishments is verified in the visible Serpent? for we know that all Creatures, saving Man, are dejected, and creep as it were, upon their belly, and, as one saith,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> their breast between their feet; only man, being lift up with his countenance, is taught not to set his minde upon earth, but to meditate upon heavenly things. But as
<hi>Jonathan</hi> went of all four, when <hi>he climbed up to the rock upon his hands and feet,</hi> the first book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the fourteenth chapter and the thirteenth verse; so doth man somtime grovel and creep upon earth, when he is earthly minded. But the difference that is between the Serpent and other beasts is this, The Serpent, having no legs, lyeth flat upon his belly, and is therefore called a Serpent of creeping; but other beasts, though they have their brests between their leggs, yet they doe not creep, as the Serpent doth.</p>
               <p>Another question is, How this creeping can be a punishment to the Serpent, seeing from the beginning they were created without feet? The solution is, That that which was natural before the fall, after the fall became a punishment. Nakednesse before the fall, was no matter of shame; for, <hi>The man and his wife were naked, and were not ashamed, Genesis</hi> the second chapter and the twenty fift verse; but since the fall, it is a disgrace to be naked: So now the creeping of Serpents is a signe of Gods
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> inflicted upon visible Serpents, because of the sinnes of him that is invisible, whereas in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was no punishment.</p>
               <p>Another question is, How the third part of this Sentence is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of the visible Serpent, <hi>That he eats dust?</hi> For one Prophet saith<pb n="675" facs="tcp:62585:362"/>of him, <hi>To the Serpent dust shall be his meat, Isaiah</hi> the sixty fift chapter and the twenty fift verse: And another saith, <hi>The Serpent lick; the dust, Michah</hi> the seventh chapter and the seventeenth verse; and yet in the Creation <hi>Moses</hi> recordeth, that the Serpent hath the like food that other Creatures have, of whom God saith, <hi>To every beast of the earth, fowl of the aire, and to every creeping thing upon earth, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven every green hearb for meat, Genesis</hi> the first chapter and the tenth verse. The answer is, That whereas at the first the Serpent had food in common with other beasts, now he is excommunicated, and is appointed only to feed upon the dust, not upon the earth, for that hath a moisture, and so is apt to nourish; but God did not allot unto him so much, but only to feed upon the dust, which is dry and altogether without moisture: So that all men may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently see, both by the motion and feeding of the Serpent, that the Curse of God is upon him, because the Devil, that old Serpent, did use him as a means to perswade man to sinne against God.</p>
               <p>As for the invisible Serpent, these punishments pronounced by God are verified in him also, but not literally; for he hath no
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of body, and therefore cannot creep: but as he is a spirit, so <hi>we must judge and discern spiritual things spiritually,</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the second chapter; for he hath a spiritual brest and belly, he hath a spiritual creeping and feeding. For his moving, we are first to consider the motion as it offereth it self: First, It is the basest and vilest motion that is; to signifie unto us, that the dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Devil is a more
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> dejection and overthrow than any can be: For where at the first, he was an Angel of light, appointed to be a Minister in Heaven, now he is cast down into the deepest Hell, and is there occupied in all base and vile service. Now he doth bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie himself in nothing so much as how to work wickednesse, and to destroy the souls of men. Of this dejection our Saviour speaks, <hi>I saw Satan, as it were lightning, fall down from Heaven, Luke</hi> the tenth chapter and the eighteenth verse: And of him, to his shame, it is said, <hi>How art thou fallen from Heaven, that said, I will ascend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and exalt my throne above the starres of God, Isaiah</hi> the fourteenth chapter and the twelfth verse: For it is a great shame for a Prince and noble person, that hath been occupied in matters of State, to be thrust into the Kitchen, to be a drudge. So is it with the Devil, the invisible Serpent, who, having been, before, a Minister in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, doth now creep upon earth <hi>and compasse it, Job</hi> the first chapter: And, as Christ saith, <hi>He walks through dry places, Luke</hi> the eleventh chapter and the twenty fourth verse, that is, he delights to be in souls that are defiled with all manner of sinne, and if he cannot be received there, he will
<hi>enter into the Swine, Matthew</hi> the eighth chapter.</p>
               <p>And then doth he creep, when he makes men to minde earthly things, <hi>Philippians</hi> the third chapter and the second verse: As this word sheweth, that the reward of pride is and shall be basenesse; so from his creeping, we are taught what is his fraud and deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:62585:363"/>These things that have feet and goe, cannot move without some noyse, but the way of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth passe mans understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for that it leaveth no impression,
<hi>Proverbs</hi> the thirtieth chapter: In this sense the Apostle saith,
<hi>Some false brethren have crept in, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> the second chapter and the fourth verse; and, <hi>these creep into widows houses,</hi> the second epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp; the third chapter. This kinde of creeping is nothing else but a privy kinde of beguiling and deceiving such as we finde to have been used by the Devill, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the twelfth chapter. Therefore we must have a special regard of the Devil when he comes to us in this manner, for then is he more to be feared, than when
<hi>he seeks about like a roaring Lyon, whom to devour,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> the fift chapter and the third verse. The Devil is said to creep, to signifie thus much, That as creeping things doe not fly about our heads, nor keep even pase with us, so the old Serpent is alwaies aiming at our lowest part, as it were at the heel, tempting us by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality, to the sinne of uncleannesse and intemperance. Secondly, We are to consider the manner of this motion, which is expressed by the original word, to be upon the brest and belly; whereby we have shewed to us two main
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: For when he creeps upon his brest, by the listing up of himself he brings the temptation of the brest, that is, he would have us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> up with pride, and exalt our selves. When he creeps upon his belly, he tempts us to desire the forbidden fruit and apple that was so goodly and pleasant to look upon; and under this is comprehended both the sinnes of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and lust. In this manner we are to observe the means whereby he perswades men to these sinnes. In the breast is the heart; and when he labours to take the possession of the heart, by corrupting our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts, then he creeps upon his brest. And his creeping upon his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> betokens the actual accomplishment of sinne. So we see that albeit the Devil be a spirit, yet by a spiritual analogie he creeps upon his breast and belly no lesse than the visile Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, After the casting down of Pride, we come to consider the sinne of Lust, and the punishment laid upon it, which is, <hi>To eate the dust.</hi> The invisible Serpent doth not eate only corporally, but spiritually he may be said to eate; for in spiritual matters there is a thing answerable to eating: We say, in regard of the delight we take in somthing this is meat and drink to us: And so the Holy Ghost also speaks, <hi>I esteem of thy word above my appointed food, Job</hi> the twenty third chapter; And Christ saith, <hi>My meat is to doe the will of him that sent me, John</hi> the fourth chapter; by which is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the delight and contentment of the minde: So whatsoever the Serpent delights in, that he may be said to eat and seed upon. Secondly, this word implyeth not only a delight, but a devouring and a destroying; as in the Prophets it is said, <hi>The sword and famine shall devour,</hi> the second book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the third chapter and the twenty sixt verse, not that it can devour, but is a means to consume<pb n="677" facs="tcp:62585:363"/>and destroy.

               <p>For the dust which is appointed for his food, there is a spiritual thing correspondent also to it; for where God promiseth unto
<hi>Abraham, Thy seed shall be as the dust, Genesis</hi> the thirteenth chapter; and, <hi>as the starres of Heaven, Genesis</hi> the twenty second chapter; upon these places the Fathers gather, That of <hi>Abraham</hi> should come both a dusty and earthly generation, not expressing the faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and also a heavenly generation, that should shine and give light to the world, as it were starres, with the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their life. And <hi>David</hi> saith plainly, <hi>That the ungodly art as dust, Psalm</hi> the first; for whatsoever lyeth along upon the earth will

                  </gap> dust: the earth it self, being without moisture, turneth to dust, so that the least winde that comes, bloweth it away: So the idle person that lyeth along, and hath no vocation to follow, doth gather dust, and is subject to be scattered with the wind. And they that somtime had some moisture and dew from Heaven, if they lose it, so <hi>as their soul waxe dry, Numbers</hi> the eleventh chapter, the Devil will send them a winde that shall carry them away; for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is <hi>to be in dry places, Matthew</hi> the twelfth chapter; and, <hi>in places without moisture, Luke</hi> the eleventh chapter. The winde wherewith they shall be carried away is, <hi>every winde of doctrine, Ephesians</hi> the fourth chapter: Therefore we must beware, <hi>that we be not clouds without water,</hi> as <hi>Jude</hi> calls the wicked, verse the twelfth; and, <hi>that we fall not from our own stedfastnesse,</hi> the second epistle of <hi>Peter,</hi> the third chapter and the first verse, which we cannot chuse but doe, if we loath prayer and other spiritual exercises, whereby the dew of Heaven doth descend upon us. And as it is in Religion, so also in matter of the Common-wealth, wherein we shall finde that this drynesse is a cause of much evil; for those light and idle persons which <hi>Jerohoam</hi> took unto himself, turned to his destruction, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond book of <hi>Chronicles</hi> and the thirteenth chapter. Seeing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil delights in these dry souls and loose parts of the earth, how is it a punishment laid upon him to feed on them: It is indeed a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he would have other meat; for so soon as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> is borne anew by regeneration, the Devil is ready to devout the childe, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> the twelfth chapter: So he would have devoured Christ himself, <hi>Matthew</hi> the fourth chapter: So he desired to have sed on <hi>Job</hi> and all other godly men, which are the starres of Heaven. But he is excluded from that food, and is to feed only upon the wicked, who being dry and destitute of the grace of God, are fitly compared to the dust. And as the Devil himself is accursed; so they that are<pb n="678" facs="tcp:62585:364"/>allotted to him for food, <hi>are cursed Children,</hi> the second epistle of
<hi>Peter,</hi> the second chapter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is said (<hi>all the dayes of thy life.</hi>) This punishment is laid upon him, as God speaks here, (<hi>because thou hast done this:</hi>) upon him not as he is the red Lyon; but the Tempter, as he is a spirit, he is immortal and hath no end of life, but the dayes of his temptation shall have an end at the comming of Christ to judgement; as he is the red Dragon condemned in Hell, he hath no end, but shall goe into everlasting fire, where he shall have no end of torment. The Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, the old Serpent, is loose but for a little season, but after <hi>he shall be bound and cast into the bottomlesse pit, Apocalyps</hi> the twentieth chapter the second and third verses.</p>
               <p>Here is matter of admonition, That we avoid those sinnes which we see so severely punished by God in the invisible Serpent, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Malice, in speaking evil of God and hurting our neighbours; Then to beware of Pride, which God doth punish with basenesse: Lastly, to detest the prosecuting of our own inordinate lust, because that will deprive us of the blessed food, so as we shall have nothing to feed upon but the dust. We must not putrifie in idlenesse, but get up and take our strength unto us, and cherish the moisture and dew of Heaven which we have received, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the fifty second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>So here is matter of faith and comfort; for this Curse pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by God upon the Devil, turns to a blessing to us: For <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had cause of comfort, seeing that God took their fall, wrought by the Devil, so grievously.

                  <hi>shall bruise the Serpents head;</hi> that is, shall both destroy him that had the power of death, and set at liberty those <hi>that were subject to the bondage of sinne, Hebrews</hi> the second chapter and the fourteenth verse. For thus doth God speak, in effect, to the Serpent, Thou supposest that thou hast deceived them already, and taken them captive, so as they shall never escape thee; but know that I will take them out of thy Jaws, and set them at liberty; <hi>thou did'st boast in thy malice, Psalm</hi> the fifty second, but I will not only take away this thy boasting, by delivering them from that destruction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto thou hast brought them, but they shall have a hand over thee; for where thou shalt but bruise his heel, he shall break thy head. On the other side, of our Parents, he saith on this manner, That howsoever they, by sinning against his expresse Commandement, had destroyed themselves, yet God, instead of delivering them to their enemy the Devil, will make them to wage warre with him, and to get the victory of him: And so this was a blessed disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing both of the Serpents malice, and also of mans despara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This course God took in two respects.</p>
               <p>First, That the Devil should not wax proud against God, if his devise touching mans destruction had prospered. God had said at the first.
<hi>Let us make man after our own Image,</hi> and he created him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the same, <hi>Genesis</hi> the first chapter; which, although it was decayed by the malice of the Devil, yet God (to shew that neither mans unfaithfulnesse, nor the Devils malice can make Gods faith of none effect, <hi>Romans</hi> the third chapter and the fourth verse) hath taken order, <hi>That his Image in man should be renewed, Ephesians</hi> the fourth chapter.</p>
               <p>Another respect that God had herein, was to shew <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Posterity, That whereas the Devil would make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that God did maligne and envie their good estate, this was but a false suspition; for, as he doth not delight in the destruction of any, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the eighteenth chapter and the thirty second verse, so when men, by sinne, had wrought their own destruction, yet he is so mercifull, that he forgives their misdeeds and destroyeth them not, <hi>Psalm</hi> the seventy eighth and the thirty eighth verse: So when it was in his hands to have destroyed our Parents for their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, yet he did not destroy them, but provided a means of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for them. And as <hi>the father, seeing his sonne afarre off, ran and met him and imbraced him, Luke</hi> the fifteenth chapter; so God, that our Parents should not despair of mercy, prevents them by telling the Serpent, that he hath a way to deliver them out of his bondage, before he pronounceth any Sentence upon them; for the Sentence given upon the Man and his Wife, was after this promise: And those two, that is, the Malice and Pride of the enemy, at our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and Gods mercy, are the two motives whereby the Church perswadeth God to be gratious unto her, <hi>Lamentations</hi> the first chapter and the ninth verse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="681" facs="tcp:62585:365"/>Touching this objection, Why God doth utter this promise by way of commination to the Serpent, whom it concerneth not, and doth not rather direct his speech to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve?</hi> it may be thus answered: That beside Gods custom, which is <hi>in wrath to vemem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her mercy, Habakkuk</hi> the third chapter and the second verse; <hi>in the valley of Achor to open a dore of hope, Hosea</hi> the second chapter and the fifteenth verse; and, <hi>to cause light to shine cut of darknesse,</hi> and so to make the light of his favourable countenance <hi>to shine in the face of Jesus Christ,</hi> the second epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the fourth chapter and the sixth verse; when men can look for nothing but warth and disoleasure, we may see it to be reasonable, that because they had deserved nothing, therefore he doth not make his speech to them, but to the Serpent by way of a Curse, that we may know, that it is not for mans deserts that God is fayourable, but, as the Prophet speaks, <hi>It is for his own sake that he doth put away our iniquities, Isaiah</hi> 43. 52.</p>
               <p>The parts of this verse are two: First, a proclaiming of hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity between the Serpent and the Woman, and between his seed and hers. Secondly, a promise of victory to the woman and her seed.</p>
               <p>Here the wisdom of God doth observe a wonderfull proportion between the Devils fault and the punishment: Before, his evil spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king was rewarded with curse, his Pride with creeping, his Lust with loathsome feeding on the dust; and here that visor and shew of friendship, whereby he tempted our first Parents to transgresse Gods Commandement, is taken away by open hostility. He made a great shew of love and good will to <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve;</hi> and, as one saith, howsoever he were indeed a cruel adversary, yet he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself, in outward shew, to be a faithfull Counsellor: But this preposterous agreement of theirs, <hi>with Hell and death, Isaiah</hi> the twenty ninth chapter, is broken off by God himself; who, instead of the Devils love fained, saith, <hi>I will put open enmity between thee and the woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the successe which our Parents had of the Devils fained good will, it is easie to be seen, that no temptation is so dangerous as that which is offered by way of compassion and friendship; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when
<hi>Peter</hi> said to Christ, in <hi>Matthew</hi> the sixteenth chapter and the twenty second verse, <hi>Master, pitie thy self,</hi> Christs answer was,
<hi>Get thee behinde me Sathan;</hi> and therefore God useth to plague such preposterous loves and wicked agreements with deadly hatred: So God punished the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of <hi>Abimlech</hi> and the men of <hi>Sichem</hi> with bitter hatred; for he sent an evil spirit between them, which made them break their promise made to <hi>Abimelech, Judges</hi> the ninth chapter and the twenty third verse. The end of the preposterous love which <hi>Ammon</hi> bare to <hi>Thamar</hi> was such, as his hatred where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hated her after, was greater than ever his love was, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the thirteenth chapter and the fifteenth verse. So <hi>Judas,</hi> having made a wicked compact with the high-Priests
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:62585:366"/>and Scribes, to betray Christ into their hands, was rejected of them after, <hi>What is that to us? Look thou to that, Matthew</hi> the twenty seventh chapter.</p>
               <p>Touching the enmity between the Serpent and the woman, three things are here set down by God: First, that it shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall,
<hi>between thee and the woman.</hi> Secondly, it shall be mortal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, such as shall never be forgotten, but the Posterity shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it, <hi>between thy seed and hers.</hi> Thirdly, it shall be a mortal and deadly hatred,
<hi>the woman and her seed shall break the Serpents head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, when God saith not only, that thus it shall be, but that he himself will be the Author of this enmity, as he saith (<hi>I will put</hi>) we are to consider two things.</p>
               <p>First, That God himself is the ruler and stirrer up of our inward affections, that he is not only <hi>the searcher of our hearts, Acts</hi> the first chapter, but <hi>the turner of mens hearts, Proverbs</hi> the twenty first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for so <hi>he turned the Kings heart toward Esther, and gave her favour with him, Esther</hi> the fift chapter: <hi>When a mans wayes please the Lord, he will turn the hearts of his enemies, so that they shall be his friends; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> the sixteenth chapter and the seventh verse: Thus he turneth mens mindes both in good and evil things. When the Serpent and our Parents conspired together in that which was evil, God turned their hearts, and made them hate one another. So when all People and Nations that were escaped our of the flood conspired to build a Tower, <hi>God himself counfounded and scattered them, Genesis</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter. So, as he is the God of peace in good things, so in evil things he will be the God of discord; and therefore he saith, <hi>I came to send a sword on earth, Matthew</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As by these words he sheweth, that all our affections are in his hand; so he teacheth us, that where he proclaimeth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, we ought not to compound or make any peace: Because God saith, <hi>I will put enmity between the Serpent and the seed of the woman,</hi> therefore we must not make any league with the Devil, sinne, the world, or our own lusts, but wrestle or be at warre with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</p>
               <p>The persons between whom this enmity is proclaimed, is the Serpent and the Woman, which must first be literally understood of the visible Serpent; for that Creature, of all other, doth strike a terror into man when he seeth him, so that presently man is infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with hatred against the Serpent.</p>
               <p>Here this question ariseth, Whether this antipathy that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally between Man and the Serpent were before the Curse, or only after?</p>
               <p>The answer is, That there was a hatred between them from the beginning, as of the Wolf with the Lamb and the Lyon, <hi>Isaiah</hi> the eleventh chapter and <hi>Isaiah</hi> the sixty seventh chapter; but this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred did not shew it self between them, but was stayed with the same grace, by which man should have been preserved from death, if he had not sinned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="683" facs="tcp:62585:366"/>There is an antipathy between the body of man and fire, so as the one is apt to destroy the other, as by grace this was stayed in the three Children that were call into the furnace, <hi>Daniel</hi> the ninth chapter. Water would naturally drown the body of man, being heavy, but by grace nature is stayed, as when <hi>Peter</hi> walked upon the water,
<hi>Matthew</hi> the fourteenth chapter. And the Lyon is a beast given to devour, being naturally hatefull, but when <hi>Daniel</hi> was cast into the Lyons den, God by his grace preserved the Prophet, so as the Lyons had no power of him, <hi>Daniel</hi> the sixt chapter. So the hatred that is in man toward the Serpent naturally did not shew it self in the Creation as it doth now, that man is fallen from his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie.</p>
               <p>The same is also verified in the invisible Serpent, if we compare spirituall things with spirituall, in the first epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the second chapter: For though <hi>Adams</hi> wife were, in regard of sin, rather the mother of the dead than of the living, as she is called, in the third chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and the twentieth verse, yet for the hope of life, which God doth offer unto us in this feed, <hi>Adam</hi> calleth her not amisse, <hi>The mother of the living,</hi> for that she was a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Church within: All that will be pertakers of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must be born anew, to lead a spirituall life: For, in the twelfth chapter of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> the Church is compared to a woman with Child, and the Devil to a Dragon persecuting the woman, to shew the spirituall enmity that is between the Devill and the faithfull, between whom, God doth here forerell, there shall be perpetuall hostility.</p>
               <p>The seed of the woman, principally, and by way of eminency, is Christ, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it, in the third chapter to the
<hi>Galatians;</hi> and the Church which is called Christ, in the first epistle to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> the twelfth chapter and the twelfth verse, doth, by the preaching of the word, conceive a spirituall seed, and travail till she have brought forth, <hi>Galatians</hi> the fourth chapter; and the old Serpent, of whom Christ faith, in the eighth chapter of St. <hi>John, You are of your father the Devil,</hi> hath no doubt a seed, that is, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, which are his Children, which are alwaies at warre with the seed of the Church. As the seed of Serpents doth prove to be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents; so, for that wicked men are the seed of the old Serpent, Christ calls them <hi>Serpents, Matthew</hi> the twenty third chapter: and because <hi>Judas</hi> was the child of the Devil, therefore Christ calleth him <hi>a Devil, John</hi> the sixth chapter &amp; the seventieth verse. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the wicked are called Serpents, is because they stop their cares like Serpents, <hi>and will not hear the voyce of the

                  <hi>There is a corrupt seed, Isaiah</hi> the first chapter and the fourth verse; The other, <hi>a holy seed, Isaiah</hi> the sixth chapter and the thirteenth verse. Our Saviour expounds
<hi>the good seed to be the children of the kingdome, and the cockle to be the children of the world, Matthew</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter and the thirty eighth verse. The Apostle compares <hi>the children of God and the children of the Devil</hi> together, the first epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>John</hi> the third chapter and the tenth verse: between these is that perpetual enmity that is here spoken of. The same is between <hi>the Church of God, Acts</hi> the twentieth chapter, and <hi>the Synagoue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, Apocalyps</hi> the twenty ninth chapter: between the two Cities, <hi>the Citie of God, whose foundation is upon the holy hill, Psalm</hi> the eighty seventh, and <hi>great Babylon, Psalm</hi> the hundred thirty seventh, and <hi>Apocalyps</hi> the eighteenth chapter: between the two Camps or Tents, whereof the Prophet speaks, that is, <hi>the Tabernacles of the Lord God of Hostes,</hi> and <hi>the Tents of the ungodly, Psalm</hi> the eighty fourth. This enmity is within every one of us, as
<hi>Peter</hi> speaks, <hi>Abstain from fleshly lusts, which wage warre against the soul,</hi> the first epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Peter,</hi> the second chapter and the eleventh verse; <hi>We wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with spiritual wickednesse, Ephesians</hi> the sixth chapter; therefore he saith, <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but spiritual and mighty through God to overthrow strong holds,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the tenth chapter and the fourth verse. And the thing that God aimeth at is, that there be not only an enmity between these two Cities and Camps, but that this enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be perpetual, and send at the least to the killing of sinne, and to the vanquishing of Sathan. So soon as this Sentence was given, there was enmity between <hi>Cain,</hi> the seed of the Serpent, <hi>who was of the evil one,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>John,</hi> the third chapter and the twelfth verse, and <hi>Abel,</hi> who was spiritually be gotten by the Church, <hi>of the seed of the world, Genesis</hi> the fourth chapter. <hi>Ismael</hi> and
<hi>Isaac, the one being born after the flesh, the other after the spirit, persecuted one another, Galatians</hi> the fourth chapter. He that was of the Serpents seed mocked and derided the seed of the woman, <hi>Genesis</hi> the twenty first chapter and the ninth verse. <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> being divers seeds, the one hated the other, and vowed to kill the other,
<hi>Genesis</hi> the twenty seventh chapter and the fourty first verse. Lastly, This enmity was practised between <hi>the Church of God,</hi> (<hi>Apocalyps</hi> the twelfth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,) and <hi>the Synagogue of Sathan</hi> (<hi>Apocalyps</hi> the nineteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.)</p>
               <p>Of these spiritual Combats the Scripture hath many examples; and therefore it is called, <hi>The book of the warres of the Lord, Numbers</hi> the twenty first chapter and the fourteenth verse. The Serpent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to have been utterly destroyed; and God, <hi>who calleth things that were not as if they were, Romans</hi> the fourth chapter and the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse, was able to have destroyed him, at least to have chained him up, that he might not trouble his servants as he will at the last day, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> the twentieth chapter and the tenth verse: but the Councel of God, in suffering him still to practise his malice<pb n="685" facs="tcp:62585:367"/>against us, is for our good, that we should be still exercised and kept in a warre; for, as Christ saith,
<hi>What thanks is it, Luke</hi> the sixth chapter and thirty second verse, and
<hi>what praise is it to obtain eternal life,</hi> the first epistle of
<hi>Peter</hi> the second chapter and the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth verse, unlesse in this life we doe somthing towards it? The Apostle saith, <hi>No man is crowned except he strive aright,</hi> the second epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> the second chapter and the fifth verse: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath appointed us an enemy, that is, the Devil, whom we must continually fight with. If we resist his allurements by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and his terrors in oppressing us with crosses, we shall, at the length, be crowned with the crown of life; and <hi>then he will,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promise, <hi>tread down Sathan under our foot,</hi> so that he shall not trouble us any more, <hi>Romans</hi> the sixteenth chapter and the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth verse. But in the mean time, he is opposed against us by the wise Councel of God, as an enemy, that we should continually strive against him.</p>
               <p>As this is a threatning to the Devil, so it is a promise in respect of us, and that a promise of grace, to be shewed us that are of the seed or the woman, without which grace we cannot strive with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, nor once conceive any desire to resist him. And therefore if we have any desire to resist the Devil and his temptations, it is not of any natural power of our selves, but the grace of Gods spirit working in us, who saith, <hi>I will put enmity between thy seed and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> Whereupon, whereas the Apostle saith, that by reason of the continual rebellion that is between the flesh and the spirit, <hi>we cannot doe that we would, Galatians</hi> the fifth chapter and the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that yet we are bound to thank God that he gives us his spirit to stirre us up to the resisting of the flesh and the corrupt lusts thereof; for hereby he perform his promise which he makes in this place: And except we had the grace of his spirit, it were impossible for us, but that we should be at agreement with the flesh, and like well of the temptations thereof; for natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we are given <hi>to make league with bell and death, Isaiah</hi> the twenty ninth chapter and the fifteenth verse; to be friends with our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And if by the special grace of God, he work in us some dislike of our flesh and the corruption thereof, for a time, yet this is not perpetual; and though it did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue perpetually, yet it is not

We see this enmity was fulfilled between the Devil and Christ, that was the seed of the woman, for they say, <hi>What have we to doe with thee, Jesus? Matthew</hi> the eighth chapter and the twenty ninth verse; and between him and the wicked Jews, which were of the Serpents seed, which said to Christ, <hi>Behold, a glutton and a wine drinker, a friend to Publicans and sinners, Matthew</hi> the eleventh chapter and the nineteenth verse.

                  <note place="margin">Aug 10. 1598.</note>IN this last part of the Curse pronounced by God upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, there are two points, First, a proclaiming of warre: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a promise of Victory; the summe whereof is,
<hi>the breaking of the Serpents head,</hi> as the holy Ghost speaks here; or, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, in the first epistle of <hi>John</hi> and the third chapter, <hi>the loosing of the works of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the proclaiming of enmity we have to consider, First, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity it self: Secondly, the persons between whom it shall be.</p>
               <p>Touching the enmity, we shewed first, That it is kindly, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous love and amity should end in hatred and mortal enmity, as it fell out between the Serpent and the woman: Secondly, That God is the author of this enmity, who saith of himself, <hi>I will put en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:</hi> Whereupon we gather, That as God is the stirrer up of all affections, so especially of that hatred which is between good and evil, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and error, between <hi>Babel</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> the Tents of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and the wicked, as they are opposed in the eighty fourt
<hi>Psalm:</hi> And therefore, as it is Christs rule, <hi>That no man should separate that which God hath joyned, Matthew</hi> the nineteenth chapter; so where God promiseth, that he will
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the wicked and the godly, let no man seek to conjoyn them, nor make peace, when his will is, there should be mortal hatred and warre.</p>
               <p>The persons are the Woman and the Serpent. By the Woman
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:62585:368"/>is meant not <hi>Eve,</hi> as she is the mother of them that dye, but the Church which is signified by her, in regard whereof, she is called <hi>The mother of the living, Genesis</hi> the third chapter and the twentieth verse. As allo the bodily Serpent is not meant, but the Devil, that old Serpent.</p>
               <p>The first thing then, to be noted in the persons, is, That as there is naturally a hatred between the Woman and the visible Serpent; so God threatneth this as a punishment to be laid upon the Devil, That there shall be continual warre and harred between him and the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This enmity shall not be for a time; for he contents not himself to say, <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the Woman,</hi> but that it shall continue <hi>between their seed;</hi> that is, it shall be hereditary, to abide till the worlds end, so long as God hath a Church. By
<hi>the seed of the Woman</hi> is understood the faithfull, that are born and begotten in the Church, which is the mother of us all, <hi>Galatians</hi> the fourth chapter. By <hi>the Serpents seed</hi> is meant the wicked, whom Christ calls <hi>Serpents, and a generation of Vipers, Matthew</hi> the twenty third chapter and the thirty third verse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It shall be no light harred, but deadly and mortal; for it shall proceed to grinde one another to powder. The hatred which the Church beareth towards the Devil, is such as shall break his head in peeces, <hi>as an earthen vessel is broken, so that it shall not be fit for any use, not so much as to fetch fire in any peece of it, Isaiah</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth chapter and the fourteenth verse. Wherefore touching this former part, As it is a great punishment for a proud man to have them set before him, whom he thinks to be farre under him; so, for as much as the Devil hold us captive at his will, the second epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to <hi>Timothy</hi> and the second chapter, it is a grievous curse which God layeth upon him, that we shall not only be set at libetry from him, but have the mastery over him, and trample him under our feet. Secondly, for our selves, As it is a blessing for a man, not to be deceived of him whom he thinks to be his friend; so God vouchsafeth us a great blessing, in that he promiseh to ftirre up in us a hatred against sinne and the Devil, so that
<hi>we shall not make a league with hell, nor an agreement with death, Isaiah</hi> the twenty eighth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but shall still be at enmity with him. Contrari wise, if we make truce with the Devil, and please our selves in our sinnes, then are we accursed, and like the fool that laugheth when he is lead to the Stocks to receive correction, <hi>Proverbs</hi> the seventh chapter. Thirdly, It is a general Prophecie, That if God
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not enmity between us and the Serpent in this life, he will set enmity between us and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the life to come; so that we shall say, <hi>How have we hated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and our hearts despised correction? proverbs</hi> the fift chapter and the twelfth verse:
<hi>Sinne goeth down sweetly, but in the end it will bite like a Serpent, Proverbs</hi> the twenty third chapter and the thirty second verse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="688" facs="tcp:62585:369"/>Thus we see, that because we did abuse that general peace that was between us and the Creatures, God hath thought it necessary to stirr up war between us; so that we shall have the Devil an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to us: And as he tempted us to evil, so we shall still be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to him. God indeed might easily have destroyed the Devil, for causing us to sinne, as well as he could make him of nothing: But because it is no praise for man not to yeild to sinne, when they have none to tempt them thereunto; nor to be obedient to Gods will, when they have none to perswade them to rebellion, as in the beginning the Serpent did; therefore he thought good that the Devil should still be their enemy, as he was at the first; for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of reward is made to them that strive and overcome, <hi>To him that overcommeth will I give, Apocalyps</hi> 12. and they must not only fight, but <hi>fight lawfully,</hi> or else they cannot be crowned, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond epistle to
<hi>Timothy,</hi> the second chapter. As for this cause God thought it good, that this warre and hostility should continue; so, because he knew men doe make warre in vain, where there is no hope of victory, therefore he proclaims, that the womans seed shall not only be at continual warre with the Serpent, but shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him and grince his head in pieces, the more to encourage them in this spiritual battel. There shall be hurt done on both parts, but not like hurt; they shall both bruise, but the same thing shall not be bruised; the head, which is the chief part, is bruised by the Woman, and therefore she hath the greater victory; the heel or tail, which is the lowest part, is only bruised by the Serpent; and consequenly doing lesse hurt, he is put to the worse. The seed of the Woman doth so fight with the Devil, that they break his head, but the Devil fights so as he doth no great hurt. Wherein two things are to be considered: First, What this Victory is, namely, the bruising and grinding in pieces of the Serpents head. Secondly, The condition of this Victory, to wit, that it shall not be with ease, for it shall cost both sweat of brows and shedding of blood, <hi>for we must resist sinne unto blood, Hebrews</hi> the twelfth chapter. And the holy Ghost saith here, that howsoever the womans seed doe bruise the head of the Serpent, yet the Serpent shall bruise his heel.</p>
               <p>In the Victory we are to observe, First the person that shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, that is, <hi>the womans seed.</hi> Secondly, the manner how, and that is <hi>by bruising his head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The person receiveth two considerations; for <hi>by the seed of the Woman</hi> we must understand not only Christ, but the whole Church, which is his body. This Scripture concerns Christ, as he is <hi>the wheat corn, which being caft into the ground and dying, bringeth forth much fruit, John</hi> the twelfth chapter and twenty fourth verse: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the faithfull as they are the ear of corne, or the crop that commeth of that grain of wheat: And as he was the seed of the Woman so are the faithfull to the end of the world. Therefore of the Church the Propher saith, <hi>That when he shall offer up his soul as an</hi>
                  <pb n="689" facs="tcp:62585:369"/>
                  <hi>offering for sinne, he shall see a long seed, Isaiah</hi> the fifty third chapter. And where the holy Ghost reporteth, that the Dragon makes warre with the rest of the Womans seed,
<hi>Apocalyps</hi> the twelfth chapter and the seventeenth verse, by that is meant the congregation of the faithfull to the worlds end; who, for that they are a body politick, as Christ is a body natural, are therefore called
<hi>Christ,</hi> the first epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the thirteenth chapter and the twelfth verse; And this victory is verified in them no lesse than in Christ. So that in this promise we see not a <hi>Fiat lux,</hi> that is, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> as in the Creation, but <hi>Fiat Christus, Let there be a Christ,</hi> that is, a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, to restore mankinde, being now fallen from the estate wherein they were created: For where God promiseth, That there shall be warre between the Serpent and the Womans seed, and that the one shall conquer the other: As if <hi>Adam</hi> should object, How shall our seed be able to strive with Sathan, seeing they themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in state of perfection, could not tread upon his head, but were tempted and overcome? God answers, That he will raise them up a Captain. As of the Judges, whom God appointed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the People of Israel, it is said, <hi>The Lord raised them up a Captain, Judges</hi> the eleventh chapter; so here God promiseth to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> that he will raise up the Captain or Prince <hi>Messiah, Daniel</hi> the ninth chapter and the twenty fift verse, that shall fight and get the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest for them, and that he shall come of their seed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If God will raise up this Captain of the Womans seed, then he shall not be an Angel or Archangel that shall deliver us; for as the Apostle saith, <hi>He in no sort took the nature of Angels, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> 12.
15. <hi>but he took the seed of Abraham;</hi> that is, he shall be man, compassed with the same flesh that we carry about with us; he shall be bone of our bones; and, as the Prophet speaks, <hi>The Captain shall be of themselves, and the Prince shall spring out from among them, Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> the thirtieth chapter; so Christ, who is appointed by God his Father, to be the Saviour of the world, is of your selves, and took our flesh upon him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God saith not your seed, but the Womans seed; which is a plain manifestation of the ordinary work of God; As if God should say to the Devil, Thou beginnest with the Woman, which is <hi>the weaker vessel,</hi> the first epistle of <hi>Peter,</hi> the third chapter, thinking to prevail the sooner; But how weak soever she be, thou shalt finde, that out of her will I bring a seed that shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt thereby see <hi>that my power is made perfect in weaknesse,</hi> the second epistle to the <hi>

Thirdly, For that <hi>Eve,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that her credulity, in hearkning to the Serpents voyce, was the cause of all his misery, might, as that sex is most inclined thereunto, conceive great grief of heart to comfort her, the promise of victory is by God himself in great mercy appropriated to her, whereas Christ came of <hi>Adam</hi> no lesse than of the Woman.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That it might be the gate to all Prophecies, For, as one saith of Christ, He is so the Womans seed, as he is not the Mans, therefore
<hi>Isaiah</hi> saith, <hi>Behold, a Virgin shall conceive, Isaiah</hi> the seventh chapter; and in the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> God speaks thus,
<hi>Behold, I create a new thing in earth, a Woman shall compasse a Man, Jeremiah</hi> the thirty first chapter and the twenty second verse: Which seed, of whom he came, the Scripture doth particularly set down: For among the sonnes of <hi>Noah,</hi> he came of <hi>Shem;</hi> among those that came of
<hi>Abraham</hi> he was of the Tribe of <hi>Juda;</hi> in that Tribe he came of the house of <hi>David,</hi> and so is called, <hi>The Sonne of David, Matthew</hi> the first chapter; and, <hi>made of the seed of David according to the flesh, Romans</hi> the first chapter: He is that seed in whom God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<hi>Abraham, That all the Nations of the earth should be blessed,</hi> as the Apostle expounds it, in the third chapter of the epistle to the
<hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, For the manner how that Victory is gotten, It is by bruising the Serpents head. Wherein, for the bruising, we learn that Christ goeth not to work by subtilty, as the Serpent did; he pretends not love, as Sathan did; but he professeth deadly hatred; he deals not creepingly and deceiptfully, but goeth to it with open force and violence: He that hurts the heel comes by stealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, as the Devil dealt here; but if a man will break another mans head, he will come before him, and so doth Christ. And therefore he is not like the subtil Serpent, but <hi>as the brasen Serpent, that was set up upon a pole, John</hi> the third chapter and the fourteenth verse, to shew, that his dealing is open and manifest. <hi>The Serpent having a purpose to destroy our Parents, seduced and beguiled Eve,</hi> the second epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the eleventh chapter; but Christ, having a purpose to destroy the Devil, and so save man, saith plainly, in the thirteenth chapter of <hi>Hosea, O death, I will be thy death, O Hell, I will be thy destruction;</hi> and so he speaks in the twelfth chapter of <hi>John, I, when I am lift up, will draw all men,</hi> that is, he will not entice them by fraud and subtilty, as the Serpent doth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The part to be bruised is the Head of the Serpent: Christ would not goe to the weaker part, as the tail or heel, as the Serpent doth; but to the head of the Serpent, where both his strength and poyson lyeth: so he is not minded as the Serpent was. The strength and poyson of Satan, as it is called in the twenty sixth verse of the eighteenth chapter of <hi>the Acts of the Apostles,</hi> is the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that he hideth in his head, which hath the same name in the holy tongue; but Christ bruiseth the head. Secondly, He hath poyson in his tongue, as it is in the third verse of the hundred and
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:62585:370"/>fourtieth <hi>Psalme;</hi> but Christ destroyed that poyson, as it is in the fourth chapter of <hi>Matthew</hi> and the fourth verse, with alledging, <hi>it is written.</hi> Thirdly, he hath poyson in his teeth, of which Christ saith, <hi>Now is the power of darknesse, Luke</hi> the twenty second chapter: But the chief poyson that he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to destroy us with, is the curse of the Law, which the Apostle calls, <hi>the strength of sin,</hi> in the first epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the fifteenth chapter: That Curse is of twelve forts, <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> the twenty seventh chapter, but Christ hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them away, <hi>When he became a curse for us, Galatians</hi> the third chapter. So hath he broken his head and drawn forth this poyson of it, First, by resistance: Secondly, by patience: Thirdly, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the poyson of it into his own body. Having done this, to shew, that he hath obtained a full conquest, <hi>he went up on high and lead captivity captive, Psalm</hi> the sixty eighth and the eighteenth verse. Though he were dead,
<hi>that by death he might destroy him that had the power of death, Hebrews</hi> the second chapter and the fourteenth verse, yet now he saith,
<hi>I am alive, and have the keyes of Hell and death, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps</hi> the first chapter and the eighteenth verse; <hi>He fast ned to the Crosse the hand writing, Colossians</hi> the second chapter; and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> over Hell and Death, as it is said, <hi>O Hell, where is thy sting? O death where is thy victory?</hi> the first epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the fifteenth chapter. And thus is the victory fulfilled in Christ: But for the condition, This Victory did not cost him nothing, so great a matter it is to redeem a soul, <hi>Psalm</hi> the fourty ninth; he bought his conquest at a deer rate, even with the price of his own blood; for Christs enemies did not only <hi>stander the footsteps of our annointed, Psalm</hi> the eighty ninth, but left in his humanity those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of cruelty, that made him cry, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Matthew</hi> the twenty seventh chapter; and <hi>to send forth strong cries with tears, Hebrews</hi> the fifth chapter; but still they did but bruise his heel: And so he did set all this at his heel, as we speak, that he might set us at his heart.</p>
               <p>Thus much concerning the Victory, as it was fulfilled in Christ, as he was the wheat Corne; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it is also fulfilled in the Church: For whatsoever he did, he did
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not for himself, but for the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body; and he doth infuse such virtue into his body, that as Christ said to his Disciples, <hi>Behold, I give you power to tread on Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and Scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, Luke</hi> the tenth chapter and the nineteenth verse; so shall the faithfull be able to trample the Devil under their feet, to whom this promise is made, <hi>That God shall tread down Satan under their feet, Romans</hi> the sixteenth chapter; which is a plain exposition of this promise set down by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> Christ, as he is the wisdom of God, shall communicate this power to his Church, That they shall tread under their feet that poyson of temptation which the Serpent speweth out of his mouth by resisting it, as he himself did,
<hi>Matthew</hi> the fourth chapter: They shall be able to sustain the poyson of his teeth, by not giving place to it. Though he hurt them in the heel, that is, in their earthly <pb n="692" facs="tcp:62585:371"/>parts, as substance, wealth, good name, yet they shall be able to suffer it, so long as he touch not the head. But if a man refuse to suffer detriment by Satan in these outward things, he shall have no part in the victory, because it is not gotten without bruising of the heel and some blood shed; for it is Gods will, <hi>That all shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Image of his sonne, Rom.</hi> 8. 29. for of those things which Christ in his natural body suffered, there remaineth som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which must be accomplished in his mysticall body, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. until the number of the Elect be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Here is matter of special direction for us. It is plain the promise is made to no man, but to him that is at enmity with the Serpent, with whom we must make continual warre; because, although Christ have already wounded him in his head, yet he is not dead; and though his courage be much abated, yet he still doth much mischief.</p>
               <p>In this warfare we are to learn two things, First, what we must doe to him, to practise it: Secondly, what he will doe to us, that we may avoid it.</p>
               <p>That which we are to doe to him, is to bruise his head in pieces, which we shall be able to doe, <hi>in him that strengthneth us, Phil.</hi> 4. That which he will doe to us
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that he will bruise our heel; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to take heed of him.</p>
               <p>By the Serpents head is meant the first suggestion whereby he stirreth us up to sinne; which, albeit in the beginning it were strong, when he tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> yet since the promise Christ hath weakned it, nothwithstanding, as Christ resisted the first suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. so must we, after his example, begin at the weakest part, even at the first suggestions and provocations, which seem to us to be nothing, which the Prophet signified by <hi>the children of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, which he would have dashed to the stones, Psal.</hi> 137. In that respect it is that the Church would have the little Foxes destroyed that hurt the Vines, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 12. And the Prophets counsel is, <hi>That we

Concerning which, as it is good counsel to hear this spoken, Command <hi>Eve;</hi> so it is better counsel, Take heed of the Serpent, and thou shall be safe; but if thou doe not look upon the tree, thou shalt be safer: For if we avoid the occasion of sinne, then shall not our concupiscence be stirred up; but he that maketh no conscience to

                  </gap>, if it be lightly touched, will sting and prick, but if it be crushed hard in a mans hand, it looseth the power: So if we dally with sinne, it will sting us, but if we bruise the very head of it, that is, the first motions, then it shall not hurt us: Thus did Christ, <pb n="693" facs="tcp:62585:371"/>
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. and thus he would have us doe likewise. <hi>Jacob</hi> being stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up by his mother to seek the blessing of his father, and to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit the person of his brother, answered, That he durst not, <hi>last in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a blessing he should procure acurse, Gen.</hi> 27. 12. <hi>Joseph,</hi> being solicited to uncleannesse by his Mistris, answered, <hi>How can I

                     </gap>? Gen.</hi> 39. Thus with the consideration of Gods curse and of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits towards us, must we tread the head of the Serpent. But if we be ready <hi>to make league with hell and death, Isaiah</hi> 28. that is, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the suggestions of Satan: If instead of treading him under feet, we tread under foot the blood of Christ, by which we are sanctified, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 10. if where we should labour to wound the Devil, we doe heal his wounds with sweet words, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. then are we faire from that spiritual enmity that God requireth, and doe deprive our selves of the promise of victory.</p>
               <p>This not bruising of the Serpents head will cause another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition: For that man, that for lack of grace doth not tread down concupiscence, and make it subject to the spirit of God, shall be fain to grinde his own heart, and to break it as he should have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Serpents head; for one of them must of necessity be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, either the Serpents head must be bruised and broken, or else our own heart must be broken with sorrow and grief for sinne, which is <hi>that acceptable sacrifice which God doth not despise, Psal.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Touching that which the Devil doth to us, we are taught here, That though he be grievously wounded, yet he will not give over, but make warre with the Womans seed forever. If he could, he would be at the head, but because he cannot, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at the heel, and, by little and little, layeth men down all along upon the ground, that so he may poyson the head: Thus he circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth men to make them fall, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. We must therefore chiefly look to that part which he aimeth at most, and that is the heel; and in that regard it behoveth us to have <hi>our feet shod with the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

15.</p>
               <p>The heel hath three considerations, First, <hi>Calcem
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>actionis:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>vitae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The heel of our soul is the lowest part thereof, which toucheth the earth; that is, as the Apostle terms them, <hi>our fleshly lusts,</hi> 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. and, <hi>our worldly lusts, Titus</hi> 2. 12. These affections are, as it were, the feet whereupon our souls doe walk; for the affections are the feet of the soul and minde, which, if they be corrupt, they cause the soul to sinne: therefore the Prophet complaineth, <hi>That the wickednesse of his heels compasseth him, Psal.</hi> 49. 5. meaning the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt lusts and affections of his heart: For as the cold wherewith we are troubled in our head, is first taken in our feet; so the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our opinion and understanding proceeds from our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The heel of our actions, is the end for which we doe them; wherein we must be carefull, that all we doe be done for
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:62585:372"/>Gods glory, and not for our own praise; this is it which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our reproveth in the Scribes and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>They did good works, they fasted, prayed, and gave almes,</hi> but the end of all that they did was not good, for <hi>they did it to be praised of men, Matth.</hi> 6. For it is the Devils policie, if he cannot hinder good actions, yet to corrupt mens minds, so as they shall not refer that which they doe to Gods glory, which is the right end and only thing we should aim at, but to their own praise and commendation among men. Therefore we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware for what end we doe any thing, be it never so good, namely, that it be reserred to Gods glory, according to the Apostles rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. otherwise it not only loseth commendation, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth sinfull, how goodly a shew soever it carry outwardly; <hi>for whatsoever is not of faith is sinne, Rom.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By the heel in the tird and last sense, we understand the end of our life: For at that time when all action is past, the Devil knowing that he hath but a little time to practise his malice against us, doth then most of all rage against us, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore even then especially we must oppose our selves against him, that he doe not venom and poyson our heel; that is, when we are ready to depart this life, to give us the overthrow, to drive us to desperation, and make us to despair of Gods favour. Thus we see his desire is and will be either to corrupt our affections, that we shall desire that which is evil: Or if we doe good, he will poyson the end of our actions, so as we shall not seek Gods glory but our own praise. Lastly, When we come to the end of our life, then he will be busie to weaken our faith, and to overcome us, by taking from us all other spiritual graces: And not only in these, but he will hurt us in our goods and good name. And we must be content to suffer these things at his hands, that he may not hurt our souls,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 3. We must not think it strange if we suffer detriment in temporal things, so that he doe us no hurt spiritually to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of our souls.</p>
